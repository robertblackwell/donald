<p>I am enclosing a few postcards of Cape Town. They were not very many good sights, the Esplanade and Table Mountain being the best. We are in the danger zone now, lights out at sunset, portholes closed, after tomorrow lifebelts will have to be worn all day. Expect to arrive at our next port tomorrow will write you a letter then sweetheart. Ink has run out, when there will be plenty of news.</p>
<p>Hope you are in the best of health. To my darling wife from your ever true loving husband with XXXXX Don</p>

<p>A Merry Christmas and a bright and prosperous New Year to your dear self and all at home. A mail is leaving port today for Australia so we are given the opportunity of writing a few lines. This is Christmas morning all are in a happy mood but dear old home is on the mouth of everyone. Have called at four ports, the last we stayed five days and this is the fourth day of the present port. Will write a full letter in a day or so and post it at our destination. Was at communion at 6:30 this morning. I'm in the best of health feeling very fit. Remember me to all my friends. Love to all at home and a husbands love to my dear little girl and wife with kisses.</p>
<p>Don</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>This letter is being written with my lifebelt on and it is very uncomfortable I can assure you. Yesterday we started wearing the lifebelts continuously. On Thursday, 21st December we were steaming along fairly fast on a smooth sea when all of a sudden word was sent around that a battleship could be seen. Everybody was on the lookout  H.M.S. King Alfred had put in an appearance to the port side,  immediately our escort the Aux Cruiser Orabala altered her course and steamed close to her. Shortly afterwards the Aux Cruiser rejoined us and the battleship disappeared. That's all we saw of her. Next morning Friday at 12:30 pm we arrived at Dakar, Senegal. The main Harbor is artificial, it is purely a harbour with in a harbour. Inside we passed two French cruisers Flagship Kleber and Dupleia, we birthed next to the latter. Our first impressions of Dakar from the boat was that it was very strongly fortified and from the style of buildings that it was purely French and quite different to Freetown in the fact that there were plenty of white people. We were not mistaken. Our first amusement was to get the Niggers diving for pennies, and this created a great deal of fun among the boys. The town looked very pretty, many fine, large buildings especially Government House also the Government Hospital the roofs being entirely of red tiles.</p>
<p>Great excitement was caused among the boys when French white ladies could be seen. No leave was granted. The reason for this was that a month previous a transport of Australians were given leave, got too much wine and did 10,000 pounds worth of damage which had to be paid by the Imperial government hence we had to suffer. Of course the officers. got leave.
The wharf work is done by Senegalese who wear red and blue sashes and turbans. There are a few motor cars. Small ponies seem to be the fashion and they are indeed very smart. Bought a few postcards of Dakar one I wrote on and sent to you on Christmas Day, but you may receive this letter first my dear. Will send the other postcards later.</p>
<p>Our drinking water was running short so took fresh water aboard. Well seven of us were very lucky, a boat crew was required and I happened to be selected. Went ashore at 9 pm returned to the boat at 12:45 am. Had to pull one boat load of officers ashore. Would not allow us to go up town so we spent the time with the Niggers. Tell you Dear we had the time of our lives. Also had a look at a French mailboat which was birthed nearby. The harbor was full of transport and passenger boats, a purely commercial port, no pleasure resorts.</p>
<p>On Sunday December 24 we had a lunch parade and a swimming parade and took our guns aboard. In the afternoon we witnessed a sight never to be forgotten. It was the embarkation of  several hundred Senegalese troops for the front. They are considered the finest fighting material France has and they looked it. That  marched onto the wharf led by 20 trumpeters and they could play. They were dressed in khaki with red turbans and sashes. Next followed a brass band, blue uniforms and white helmets playing the national anthem of France, then followed the soldiers with blue uniforms with red turbans and sashes, and khaki uniforms with blue turbans and sashes, and khaki uniforms with khaki helmets. It was a great sight to see these colored man off to the front, the numerous colors added to the scene. Last but not least when allowed on the wharf came the friends and relatives to see them off. We were continually giving them the Australian three cheers. Darling it reminded me very clearly of the never to be forgotten 9th November.</p>
<p>That same night which was Christmas Eve seven of us pulled around the harbor, broke through the sentry and visited the town. It was after 9 o'clock so all the shops were closed much to our disappointment anyhow we saw a good portion of the town. We consider ourselves very lucky to be able to see the town as no soldiers were allowed ashore under any consideration. We arrived back at the boat at 10:30 pm. Well darling how did you spend Christmas Day? You were not out of my mind, for one minute. You darling and home were my only thoughts.</p>
<p>This is how I spent Christmas day. 6:30 am attended holy communion, 8:30 am wrote cards to you dearest and to mum. Had a sleep before dinner. As for dinner it was as good as could be expected I suppose; soup, pork and cabbage and plum pudding. The French admiral came aboard that same afternoon and inspected all units. Had a boxing and swimming carnival. Late in the afternoon I spent an hour or so in a cabin listening to a zonophone. At night eight of us celebrated Christmas in our cabin by drinking the health of all at home, especially wives. It was only soft drink, I might mention sweetheart.  We received by wireless the King&rsquo;s Christmas message to the troops. After five days stay at Dakar we left at 7.00 am on the morning of 27th December.  The French cruiser Kleber also came with us and is still keeping watch over us. After we had been out for a short time a man fell overboard from the Afric, was picked up in about 20 minutes more the worse for his experience.</p>
<p>Today has been all excitement. We were joined by H.M.S. Kent and four other transports. It was a fine sight  seeing the nine transports and 43 cruisers moving into position. Had another death today a black soldier called Combo he was very popular and a good sport. Reveille in future is 6:45 am instead of 6 am on account of late break of day, breakfast will be 8.00am instead of seven. </p>
<p>Sweetheart if you have not already sent it please send that  other chest protector. The silk ones are no good. I posted a large number of letters at Cape Town. In fact I did not post them but gave them to a south African soldier to post. I feel sure he will do so but if you don't get any from Cape Town don't blame me dearest, sent quite a number.</p>
<p>The only game of cards that is played on board is 500, everybody plays it and I believe it is well named for I&rsquo;m positive there are 500 different ways of playing it.</p>
<p>Darling this is my last sheet of writing paper where the next is to come from I don't know, it's run completely out on board. Tea and potatoes also porridge has run completely out.
Expect to strike cold weather tomorrow or the next day.</p>
<p>Well my dear wife how are you progressing. Hope you are going ahead like a house on fire. Hope all are well at Wadhurst, give my love to all. </p>
<p>Will now close with true and sincere love to my darling wife from your loving husband with tons of kisses.</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p><span class="ps">PS</span> going to try to get back for next Christmas dearest. Germans seemed to be wanting peace. Wish peace were proclaimed so that  I could get back to my dear little wife.</p>
<p>Love Don</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>This is Monday January 1, 1917 so will wish you a bright and prosperous new year to the fullest extent to my darling wife. Owing to our being in the danger zone no New Year's Eve disturbance took place, everybody getting off to bed very early. Early this morning compliments were flying around but it was only half hearted as our thoughts were all back at home with our loved ones. I was wondering what you would be doing dear. Today the weather is great but the sea is a little choppy. In a day or so we should strike rough weather that is if we are going to get any, just received more wireless news the most interesting being England&rsquo;s answer to Germany's peace proposals. We all received 10 shillings pay today. The boys were all broke so it came just when needed. But the trouble is that the best part of it goes on drink.</p>
<p>Of the nine transports we are  the only one to have a wet canteen.</p>
<p>This is only going to be a one page letter my dear, there is absolutely no news but I thought my dear little wife would like a few lines written on the first day of the new year.</p>
<p>The food has been very much off of late, no porridge, potatoes or tea, all are craving to get to the old dart to get a good meal and a fresh water bath. </p>
<p>Again I wish my wife an exceptionally bright year, 1917. Love and kisses to my darling wife from your ever true and loving husband. Tons of kisses and embraces.</p>
<p>Don</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Just received something great two letters from you dear dated 15th and 22nd of November. It was simply great. I was feeling very down but they have braced  me up and I feel like a cat with a little live bird.</p>
<p>Keep your writing up, well dearest it is the only thing I look for. This is only going to be a very short letter dear, they is no news but I thought I would write straight away and let you know I received some letters.  Have just been inoculated and going to get paid shortly. The mud is awful, clean boots and leggings are out of the question.</p>
<p>Very pleased to hear that you are all keeping in good health. I am continually thinking of you dear,  and little &ldquo;Mac&rdquo;. Keep your pecker up dear.  Have just been paid and received the large sum of one pound two shillings, that's a total of 3 pound two shillings for the trip. </p>
<p>Our quota is all split up, scattered all over the camp. Was just speaking to Crowley his wife does not arrive until tomorrow the 14th. The  boat is a week overdue. He told me he is not going to allow her to go nursing after seeing how things are over here. They will only see one another for about three days while he is in England, this camp is a real gaol. </p>
<p>I noticed on the envelope you addressed dear, that the number was placed up In the corner, put the number in the corner also above the name. </p>
<p>Au revoir my dear wife for the present, love to my darling with love, kisses and embraces from your loving husband.</p>

<p>Here is a postcard which might interest you. Wet and cold today, ice an inch thick, had to be broken before having a wash. Snowing again yesterday. Mud right up to our knees. Went to the pictures last night, don't think I'll go again for a long time. Prices are 4p, 7and1/2p.</p>
<p>Have just written to Mr. Paton and Bearsoth.</p>
<p>No more letters to hand yet. Suppose Keith is over here by this, would like to know where he is, for his sake I hope he does not come to this camp, I don't think he will. Did a 9 mile march yesterday morning, very tired after it.
Crowley just came in and told me he just received a wire from his wife. She is safe and sound, arrived last night.Oh darling if only I could get a wire saying you were here. Suppose I will have to wait until I return. </p>
<p>Love and kisses my darling wife from your loving husband.</p>

<p>Yesterday I received your most welcomed letter, Number five. Have only received three so far, so therefore two are missing. They must be the first two letters sincerely hope they come along. It was grand receiving your letter dear it put new life into me absolutely. Some of the boys in my hut received10 to 20 letters, lucky dogs. I also received a letter from mum, she mentioned sending a Maitland Mercury along, have not received it yet waiting anxiously for same it will be grand to see the old rag. One of the boys received 2 Sydney Heralds I perused them to see if they contained any Maitland news, but disappointed. Anyhow I read  of Brigadere General Patons wounds. Was speaking to his brother today, he told me that the General was conducting a charge when something went wrong, then the general got out of the trench, next thing a sniper got him through the arm and body, it was serious, but he is doing well now.</p>
<p>The weather is still very cold, ice everywhere all  one feels fit for is bed. Have got chillblanes on the feet very badly, cannot walk about in comfort very disagreeable. I would give anything to have some New South Wales weather no matter how hot. All the boys are getting thin yours truly also. The meals we get would not satisfy a cat. Three meals put together  would not make one decent meal. Buy our tea now and again, but we cannot flash off every night of the week. Food is getting very expensive. Last Saturday morning we were inspected by Gen. Brunker, a tame sort of an affair.</p>
<p>Walking up to our hut after the inspection I noticed a lady standing nearby, who should it be but Mrs. Crowley. Of course there was great rejoicing especially by Mr. Crowley. She did not have a good time coming over, they were chased on four occasions by submarines, also they picked up two boat loads of passengers from other boats which had been damaged. Mrs. Crowley looked very washed out and much thinner. She is staying at Amesbury 4 miles from here so therefore her hubby can see her every day from five till eight o'clock. He is going to get a bike. Oh what a lucky dog. Sincerely wish you were closer dear it would be just great. 
Mr. Crowley said after what he has seen on this side he would not allow his wife to take on nursing.</p>
<p>Well you picked up a horse shoe for luck well I did the same. When in Cape Town I picked up a shoe and was looking at it when an old man said &ldquo;take that with you Laddie for luck&rdquo;, well dear I still have it. The two ought to bring luck oh kiddie. As for Vera Solling would not put it past her clearly she has not forgotten Dick.</p>
<p>Well darling there is absolutely no news in the rotten camp. Wish the darn war was over would catch the first boat home without seeing much of England. No place like dear old Maitland. I am like yourself darling always thinking and planning for he or she. Won&rsquo;t it be lovely when I'll be able to embrace you both. Keep your pecker up dearest. Will now close sweetheart look after yourself and don't worry.</p>
<p>Tons of love and kisses to my darling wife from your loving husband.</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>Keep the writing up I look forward to your letters everyday.</p>

<p>Just heard that mail closes in 20 minutes for Australia so I thought I would drop you a few short lines. There is no news, cold still cold, today has been the coldest so far. We saw the sun today for about one hour it was simply great. This morning I was detailed to go into a school for signaling. Can get out of it. Do not really know what to do. Some say it is no good, others who have been to the front say it is the best job there. The school will last about three months maybe longer. Eric Hewitt and Crowley are in with me. After considering it from the several standpoints I think I'll go on with it. Do not think it's more dangerous work kiddie, everything in that line over at the front is now done undercover. Will make more inquiries later on and I&rsquo;ll consider you too.</p>
<p>What I can personally see of it,  it's very good indeed. Anyhow can draw out of it at anytime. There's another mail ready for delivery tonight wonders if there is a letter from my dear wife sincerely hope so.
Saw by today's papers that the Pt Nicholson has been sunk. All the troops were off, so that is good. Food is getting very dear in England, and Germany from all accounts is in a very bad way. A man at the table told me that one English paper declares that the war will be over in six weeks time and if not, for every day over that time will give a certain sum to hospitals etc. I don't believe it.  But would it not be great back so soon with you darling. Anyhow time will come. Will now close for the mail.
Love and kisses to my dear wife from your loving husband</p>
<p>Don
</p>
<p>Have been thinking all day what joy it will be when we meet dearest, on the wharf on my return, the three of us. The sooner the better. Love kisses and embraces to my darling wife.</p>
<p>Love</p>

<p>Last night while over at the YMCA I heard that a mail closed the same night therefore I sat down and wrote a few lines to my dear. On returning to the hut I got a great reception what do you think it was, why three letters from my dear wife also the lettergram you sent to Freemantle. It was simply great to receive them.  First before tea tonight I received another of your loving letters. The letters received so far are numbers 1,3,5,6, and 7 therefore two and four are still missing. 7 came along today. There is no news to tell. I am still in the signal school and from numerous inquiries made it's a very good branch for the time being at any rate. Have to go through a riding school in connection with it, started this afternoon. This has been a heavy day, going strong the whole day from 6:30 AM to 7:15 PM. It's been a bitterly cold day. Some of the boys went skating on the waterhole. I did not take it on, no good to yours truly, have seen too much ice. Was very pleased when number one letter came along thought it had gone astray. </p>
<p>Keep up your writing dear, it is the only thing I look for on this side. Your letters dearest make a great difference in yours truly. Your photos were very welcomed. Will place them with the others. Of course only one will accompany me to bed that's the one of your self only. That's three I take to bed with me. Very surprised to hear that you saw me on the tram the morning of embarkation. Never mind dearest as you say we will make up for it on my return,  especially as there will be another &ldquo;Mac&rdquo; to welcome me. </p>
<p>So you won a cake, well done my little wife. You mentioned about me wanting money, don't think I'll require any for some time, have plenty at present. You say that the military money and office money is coming along okay. I am very pleased indeed. Be sure to let me know from time to time how they are treating you. One of the hut boys just received his Christmas parcel, needless to say there is great joy, everybody is eating lollies. Very sorry indeed that the photo from the camp is no good, send it back kiddie, although I suppose it is too late now.</p>
<p>So Mrs. Don McDonald is &ldquo;some class&rdquo; that's right, she always was, keep it up, darling. Little Mac will be &ldquo;some class&rdquo; too, eh sweetheart. What would I give to be home somewhere about June, what say you dearest. So the photos from the Swiss were okay, that is good. Buy fancy saying that in one of my photos I had a cantankerous look. Not me kiddie. If I could get hold of you I&rsquo;d give you a big smack on the lips, here have it X. Very sorry to hear you had trouble with your teeth, but get them stopped, false teeth are no good darling. I suppose you wrote Mrs. Asser thanking her for the scarf. I prefer the main one of the two every time. The parcel has not arrived yet, does not matter how bad the cigars are they will be very welcomed, anything from home and especially from my darling wife is welcomed in this hole. Will keep a sharp look out every day for my darling's parcel. Write just as you like dear, your letters are not censored at all so be sure and give me all the news about yourself. I'm always thinking of you and Little Mac. Same as you I was thinking how great it will be to hear the young scamp (sure to be) calling mum or dad. Of course I can guess what your dream was about wait till I come back then&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>You used the word d&hellip;. could not write it, very surprised but you are right it is worse than a d&hellip;war. The mail does not close for a couple of days so will continue this later tomorrow, going to bed now. Have not got you love to sleep with, so I do the same as you, take your photos with me. Good night darling love and kisses to my dear wife with a strong embrace. XXXXXXXX</p>
<p>Well dear another day over and nothing very startling.</p>
<p>Out riding this afternoon also received another pay of 1/-/-. Plenty of money for the present time. Saw the new Moon just a little while ago, of course had a wish. You can bet you're sweet life what it was. Have wrapped up a paper to send to dad and the soon as I finish this letter will drop a line to mum. I'm writing this in the YMCA ,&ldquo;Y Emma&rdquo; as it is known by the boys. Have not heard anything of Keith yet, I suppose he will soon reach this side.</p>
<p>Wrote a letter to Nelly Fry the other day.</p>
<p>Well dear wife I will now say au revoir. The next mail closes on 29 January so will write again before that. Love and kisses to my dear little wifey.</p>
<p>Your ever own and loving husband</p>
<p>Don
</p>
<p>PS I started numbering my letters but forgot a number so left it off. Don't think it is necessary for me to number the letters as they are sure to arrive at there destination.</p>
<p>Love and kisses</p>
<p>Hubby
</p>
<p>How is little Max getting on?</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Received your very welcomed letter dated 11th of November about a fortnight ago. I'm still going strong in this camp although things are very unsettled this week. Hundreds have been warned for draft. We are only supposed to remain here three weeks, then overseas, but of course these orders can be twisted when one is in the know. Anyhow my time for leaving may come any day. </p>
<p>Keith is in England at present on 14 days leave. We have been together for a few hours. I've just returned from a week trip to Edinburgh. Keith was to have come with me but somehow he was nowhere to be seen when the train was due to leave. </p>
<p>Scotland is a great place and needless to say I had the time of my life. Visited all places of interest including Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, St Giles&rsquo; Cathedral, Forth Bridge etc etc. Went to Leith and saw a naval ship building yard. The trip up the Firth of Forth was very fine. Also had a day and night in London. Looking forward to my next leave, Scotland will do me. </p>
<p>Love to all. Hope all are okay. Love to Neita and Bubs.</p>
<p>Your sincere son-in-law Don</p>

<p>My darling wife and funny son</p>
<p>Well kiddie it's over a week since I've written, very sorry, but I'm sure you'll forgive me when I tell you all. Last Sunday week I received a wire from  Keith stating that he was in Blighty on 14 days leave and that he was coming out to the camp on the Monday. He put in an appearance about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Cannot tell you how pleased I was to see him, he is looking grand, never saw him looking better. After a good talk we went for a walk up to see George. You ought to have seen the look on George's face when Jerry went up to him. They had so much to say that they did not know where to start. After another talk we returned to our hut had supper, then turned into bed together. It .was the early hours in the morning before we got to sleep. Jerry has been having the time of his life in France, does not wish to come back to England, says France will do him. Early next morning he left the London where he expected to have a good time. Darling I've just returned from a weeks trip to Edinburgh. Had the time of my life. Keith was coming up with me, had to meet me last Thursday night at the station, intending to go up together, but very sorry to say he failed to put in an appearance. Anyhow I went on without him, expecting him up next day, but up to the present I've not heard another word from him. He must be having a good time somewhere, suppose he's got a girl somewhere. Kiddie is a great place, the Scotch people grand. I stopped at the Crown Hotel as soon as the people knew my name they could not do enough for me. Visited all places of interest, Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, Giles Cathedral, and up to the top of the Scots monument etc etc. Have a number of postcards which of course dear I'll send along. On Sunday I went for a trip up the Firth of Forth. The bridge is wonderful. While there saw the &ldquo;Australia and New Zealand&rdquo;. They had just come in from the North Sea for a 14 day overhaul. Went to all the theatres to be sure. Always had a &lsquo;box&rsquo; did things in grand style. I knocked about with two Scotch commercial travellers, who had nothing to do, so took me around. Scotland will do me kiddie. Wait darling till I take it you and Bonny Bubs for a trip to Scotland. Returned to London yesterday morning, had the day there, went to the theatre in the afternoon and witnessed &ldquo;The Maid of the Mountains&rdquo; simply glorious. Returned to camp this morning, so dear I'm dead tired. Made several attempts while on leave to write but as  sure as I&rsquo;d start my mates would get hold of me and take me out. They would not let me pay for a thing. If I attempted to pay they would go crook, gave me a royal time, and fine chaps they were. But  had fought in France and had got their discharge.</p>
<p>Darling I bought Bubs a mug made out of the real Scottish horn and Silver mounted will post it  in a day or so. Sweetheart I&rsquo;d have  given all I possess, could I have had my two darlings with me, what a grand time we would have had. Never mind wait until I return then things will be doing, eh kiddie. Enclosing a couple of postcards. While away on leave, a number lost their jobs, but yours truly, is still going strong. Great alterations are taking place in camp. Everybody is wondering who will be next. Will write again in a day or so giving more particulars of my trip. </p>
<p>How is darling Bubs getting on and how is wifey dear. Sincerely hope both are just okay. Love kisses and embraces to my two darlings from your ever own loving hubby and father with scores and scores of kisses and embraces.   </p>
<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, Don</p>

<p>The Australian mail closes tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock so will therefore write a few lines. Still at the same camp of which there is nothing to tell you except that it is still cold, bitterly cold. Yesterday and today, a very strong wind has been blowing. If you send any papers make them up like a parcel for if tied in the usual way they will not be delivered. Only yesterday two large baskets of papers belonging to some of the men were burnt.</p>
<p>Of course I would like some Mercury&rsquo;s so wrap them parcel shape. On Friday I received a very nice letter from Mrs. S Smith. Of course she wants me to go and spend my leave with her. Cannot do that but will most certainly call and see her and possibly stay one night. Will send you a copy of the letter for you to read my dear. Yesterday I also received a letter from Nellie Fry. She wants me to go there  as soon as I get off. She explained how I could get there and what sort of time they would give me. Also I am to call her cousin. She said she was writing to Mr. Hemsley  telling him that I am here, also she wrote to her brother-in-law George Davis   (she gave me his address as well) who is in Lark Hill camp.</p>
<p>Number one I intended going to see Mr Hemsley this afternoon, but yesterday I went for a walk and just as I got back he walked into the hut. We were together for about three hours, had supper together. He is in the motor transport hut, but his right leg met with an accident so that he expects to get his discharge sooner or later.   I suppose you have heard all about him, aged 40, married, two children girls ages 10 and 12. He told me all about Goudhurst and  how they would enjoy my visit. Of course have decided to go there and drive from there to Mrs. Smith. He and George met several times and he said that George looked the picture of health. Nellie Fry had a letter from George the other day. He had been in the trenches and out and was going in again. </p>
<p>When we are to get our leave, nobody knows, don't think we will ever get it, but when we do I am off to the hop District, Goudhurst, after what I was told last night. Yesterday afternoon spent a very good time at Figheldean. It is a village about 2 miles from here. The items of interest were Longfellow&rsquo;s well known chestnut tree and blacksmith shop. Had my photos taken under the tree also had a good look at the shop. The church is opposite where is marked the exact position the blacksmiths daughter sang. Outside is his grave. After having a good look round the village we had afternoon tea which was great.  I bought a couple of postcards which I will send you, they will give you an exact idea of the place. </p>
<p>Tucker is the chief thing here, last night came across a good spot, two sausages with plenty of peas and potatoes also a cup of tea for 9p. Ink has just run out will get some more tomorrow. Have been going hard all day intended to do a little study regarding the signals but could not get five minutes to myself. Have been making numerous inquiries regarding the signal business over at the front from men who have been over there. They reckon it is the best job over there but that only applies to the artillery.</p>
<p>Well darling wife will now say au revoir until next letter which I will write in a few days. How are you and how is little Mac? Sincerely hope you are going along swimmingly. I am keeping in the best of health. Remember me to all. Love to all at home and Wadhurst. </p>
<p>Love, kisses and embraces to my darling wife from your own true hubby.</p>
<p>Tons of kisses</p>
<p>Don
</p>
<p>I am enclosing the letter received, will have to destroy it after a while so I think it would be better in your hands dearest. Love to self and Little Mac from hubby and father. Eh what. Eh what.</p>

<p>Camp life is just the same all fatigues. For the present I am a bit better off, being in the signal school. The weather is still bitterly cold, ice everywhere, a great number of the water pipes have burst. Had snow today, you can imagine my dear marching out through the snow to do the signal work, we thoroughly enjoyed it. The days are getting longer which is just what we want. </p>
<p>Had a letter from Lieut. Col. Beardsmore the other day, nothing very much in it, but said he had received a letter from his wife saying that I was here and also that Keith would be arriving shortly. He wants me to call and see him as soon as I arrive in France. Tonight I received a letter from my cousin or auntie (don&rsquo;t know the relationship for certain) Annie E Roberts. She gave me a surprise it was news, it was this, that Keith was in France. Cannot make it out. This is what she said &ldquo;I heard Keith is in France and had met Eric Roberts one of my brothers boys etc, There is a bit more about Keith when over here meeting her two brothers. The two brothers have since died. Her brother Tom and family now live in London. &#8232;Keith also met them so she wants me to call and see them. It is a fairly long letter the main point is asking me to be sure and spend my leave with her at her home at Bournemouth. As for  leave I don't think there is much chance of getting it but if we do where am I going to spend it? Have five places to stay and they are all very particular that I must go to their homes and spend my whole time with them. Not going to worry for the present. Will decide when we get the leave if ever we do.Going to write tomorrow to Annie  Roberts and ask her if she has Keith&rsquo;s  address. Fancy hearing about him from her. </p>
<p>About cooking fish why dear you make my mouth water would give all I have to be with you cooking fish, as you say darling wait until we go to the Hawkesbury, then you will have to cook for three dear.  Had a great feeling today that I would like to be taking a trip to the caves like we did last year darling, how about you dear when I get back we&rsquo;ll make the pace. This is letter number 8 that I received last night. Keep your writing up darling it is simply grand to get letters from my dear little wife, makes one feel that I'm not so very far away from home and wife. </p>
<p>As to the name of our heir to be well the boys name is okay in fact so is the girls. You asked my opinion dear well as for Novak it is not bad, did not think that name was a favorite of yours but I could  not suggest another. Girls names strange to me now, this life makes it hard to think there are girls. Novak is alright sweetheart but if I think of another I like better I&rsquo;ll tell you in a following letter. But dear wife you forget you only mentioned names of one boy and one girl, what if it's twins two boys or two girls, got you now, in case the most likely happens, I am sure it will, think of some more names dear.  What a youngster, the best ever, could not be otherwise. Round about 27th June will be dates for me to look forward to. What say you sweetheart. </p>
<p>Well dear wife I&rsquo;ll now ring off there is no more news will write again before the next mail closes which is on 5th February. Going to make a piece of toast and then go to bed. Au revoir to my darling wife with love and embraces from your own loving husband. </p>
<p>Tons of kisses.</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>I posted you a letter yesterday but as there is another mail tomorrow I will write a few lines. They is no news but a  line or 2 won&rsquo;t go amiss will they kiddie.</p>
<p>I started off calling you my little wife but I suppose you are getting bigger now  like a whale.</p>
<p>There is a lot of talk about a number of signalers going to a school in another camp right down in the south. Sincerely hope I am one to be sent, it will only be a case of luck who is sent. We are all waiting for the names to come out 25 of our men are to get their disembarkation leave next week and waiting now for the officer to come in and take our names. Four out of 6 men in our hut are to get leave so I stand a good chance. It is bitterly cold today unbearable, snow still lying about. Walking down the YMCA  steps tonight slipped on the ice came a cropper but did not get hurt.</p>
<p>We are getting starved, there&rsquo;s sure to be trouble if things don&rsquo;t improve. Anyhow I had a good tea; peas, potatoes and sausages for the sum of 1/2. Food is getting very scarce in England. Kiddie tell them at home I could not possibly write to them by this mail, too busy so if there is anything to tell you can do so sweetheart. What about doing some washing for me, have plenty to do, can't get time to do it. Not like the Warrens cannot throw it over the fence here and get my wife to do it anyhow you will have plenty of washing to do when little Mac comes along, what do you say darling. Every afternoon I attend a riding school, have to have 14 lessons to complete the course. In my next letter I hope to be able to write all about my four days leave. Sincerely hope you are in the best of health, how is the little darling getting on sweetheart. Be sure and tell me all. Remember me to all. Love and kisses to my darling wife from your most loving and sincere husband,  Don</p>
<p>Catch these dear XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>This is Wednesday morning. After I got to bed last night received a Mercury, evening news posted by mum needless to say I read every word. It was so grand to get the old paper. No doubt you'll receive this later about 18 March so will now wish you many happy returns of the day. As soon as I go on leave will buy something for my dear and post same straight away. I'll be home for your next birthday kiddie also for little Mac&rsquo;s too. We will have a good bust upon that day kiddie.
My hands are like ice it's absolutely the coldest day since we arrived. </p>
<p>Love and kisses to my darling wife. </p>
<p>Your loving husband.</p>
<p>Don</p>

<p>Just received something great two letters from you dear dated 15th and 22nd of November. It was simply great. I was feeling very down but they have braced  me up and I feel like a cat with a little live bird.</p>
<p>Keep your writing up, well dearest it is the only thing I look for. This is only going to be a very short letter dear, they is no news but I thought I would write straight away and let you know I received some letters.  Have just been inoculated and going to get paid shortly. The mud is awful, clean boots and leggings are out of the question.</p>
<p>Very pleased to hear that you are all keeping in good health. I am continually thinking of you dear,  and little &ldquo;Mac&rdquo;. Keep your pecker up dear.  Have just been paid and received the large sum of one pound two shillings, that's a total of 3 pound two shillings for the trip. </p>
<p>Our quota is all split up, scattered all over the camp. Was just speaking to Crowley his wife does not arrive until tomorrow the 14th. The  boat is a week overdue. He told me he is not going to allow her to go nursing after seeing how things are over here. They will only see one another for about three days while he is in England, this camp is a real gaol. </p>
<p>I noticed on the envelope you addressed dear, that the number was placed up In the corner, put the number in the corner also above the name. </p>
<p>Au revoir my dear wife for the present, love to my darling with love, kisses and embraces from your loving husband.</p>

<p>Here is a postcard which might interest you. Wet and cold today, ice an inch thick, had to be broken before having a wash. Snowing again yesterday. Mud right up to our knees. Went to the pictures last night, don't think I'll go again for a long time. Prices are 4p, 7and1/2p.</p>
<p>Have just written to Mr. Paton and Bearsoth.</p>
<p>No more letters to hand yet. Suppose Keith is over here by this, would like to know where he is, for his sake I hope he does not come to this camp, I don't think he will. Did a 9 mile march yesterday morning, very tired after it.
Crowley just came in and told me he just received a wire from his wife. She is safe and sound, arrived last night.Oh darling if only I could get a wire saying you were here. Suppose I will have to wait until I return. </p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Yesterday I received your most welcomed letter, Number five. Have only received three so far, so therefore two are missing. They must be the first two letters sincerely hope they come along. It was grand receiving your letter dear it put new life into me absolutely. Some of the boys in my hut received10 to 20 letters, lucky dogs. I also received a letter from mum, she mentioned sending a Maitland Mercury along, have not received it yet waiting anxiously for same it will be grand to see the old rag. One of the boys received 2 Sydney Heralds I perused them to see if they contained any Maitland news, but disappointed. Anyhow I read  of Brigadere General Patons wounds. Was speaking to his brother today, he told me that the General was conducting a charge when something went wrong, then the general got out of the trench, next thing a sniper got him through the arm and body, it was serious, but he is doing well now.</p>
<p>The weather is still very cold, ice everywhere all  one feels fit for is bed. Have got chillblanes on the feet very badly, cannot walk about in comfort very disagreeable. I would give anything to have some New South Wales weather no matter how hot. All the boys are getting thin yours truly also. The meals we get would not satisfy a cat. Three meals put together  would not make one decent meal. Buy our tea now and again, but we cannot flash off every night of the week. Food is getting very expensive. Last Saturday morning we were inspected by Gen. Brunker, a tame sort of an affair.</p>
<p>Walking up to our hut after the inspection I noticed a lady standing nearby, who should it be but Mrs. Crowley. Of course there was great rejoicing especially by Mr. Crowley. She did not have a good time coming over, they were chased on four occasions by submarines, also they picked up two boat loads of passengers from other boats which had been damaged. Mrs. Crowley looked very washed out and much thinner. She is staying at Amesbury 4 miles from here so therefore her hubby can see her every day from five till eight o'clock. He is going to get a bike. Oh what a lucky dog. Sincerely wish you were closer dear it would be just great. 
Mr. Crowley said after what he has seen on this side he would not allow his wife to take on nursing.</p>
<p>Well you picked up a horse shoe for luck well I did the same. When in Cape Town I picked up a shoe and was looking at it when an old man said &ldquo;take that with you Laddie for luck&rdquo;, well dear I still have it. The two ought to bring luck oh kiddie. As for Vera Solling would not put it past her clearly she has not forgotten Dick.</p>
<p>Well darling there is absolutely no news in the rotten camp. Wish the darn war was over would catch the first boat home without seeing much of England. No place like dear old Maitland. I am like yourself darling always thinking and planning for he or she. Won&rsquo;t it be lovely when I'll be able to embrace you both. Keep your pecker up dearest. Will now close sweetheart look after yourself and don't worry.</p>
<p>Tons of love and kisses to my darling wife from your loving husband.</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>Keep the writing up I look forward to your letters everyday.</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Just heard that mail closes in 20 minutes for Australia so I thought I would drop you a few short lines. There is no news, cold still cold, today has been the coldest so far. We saw the sun today for about one hour it was simply great. This morning I was detailed to go into a school for signaling. Can get out of it. Do not really know what to do. Some say it is no good, others who have been to the front say it is the best job there. The school will last about three months maybe longer. Eric Hewitt and Crowley are in with me. After considering it from the several standpoints I think I'll go on with it. Do not think it's more dangerous work kiddie, everything in that line over at the front is now done undercover. Will make more inquiries later on and I&rsquo;ll consider you too.</p>
<p>What I can personally see of it,  it's very good indeed. Anyhow can draw out of it at anytime. There's another mail ready for delivery tonight wonders if there is a letter from my dear wife sincerely hope so.
Saw by today's papers that the Pt Nicholson has been sunk. All the troops were off, so that is good. Food is getting very dear in England, and Germany from all accounts is in a very bad way. A man at the table told me that one English paper declares that the war will be over in six weeks time and if not, for every day over that time will give a certain sum to hospitals etc. I don't believe it.  But would it not be great back so soon with you darling. Anyhow time will come. Will now close for the mail.
Love and kisses to my dear wife from your loving husband</p>
<p>Don
</p>
<p>Have been thinking all day what joy it will be when we meet dearest, on the wharf on my return, the three of us. The sooner the better. Love kisses and embraces to my darling wife.</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Don

<p>Last night while over at the YMCA I heard that a mail closed the same night therefore I sat down and wrote a few lines to my dear. On returning to the hut I got a great reception what do you think it was, why three letters from my dear wife also the lettergram you sent to Freemantle. It was simply great to receive them.  First before tea tonight I received another of your loving letters. The letters received so far are numbers 1,3,5,6, and 7 therefore two and four are still missing. 7 came along today. There is no news to tell. I am still in the signal school and from numerous inquiries made it's a very good branch for the time being at any rate. Have to go through a riding school in connection with it, started this afternoon. This has been a heavy day, going strong the whole day from 6:30 AM to 7:15 PM. It's been a bitterly cold day. Some of the boys went skating on the waterhole. I did not take it on, no good to yours truly, have seen too much ice. Was very pleased when number one letter came along thought it had gone astray. </p>
<p>Keep up your writing dear, it is the only thing I look for on this side. Your letters dearest make a great difference in yours truly. Your photos were very welcomed. Will place them with the others. Of course only one will accompany me to bed that's the one of your self only. That's three I take to bed with me. Very surprised to hear that you saw me on the tram the morning of embarkation. Never mind dearest as you say we will make up for it on my return,  especially as there will be another &ldquo;Mac&rdquo; to welcome me. </p>
<p>So you won a cake, well done my little wife. You mentioned about me wanting money, don't think I'll require any for some time, have plenty at present. You say that the military money and office money is coming along okay. I am very pleased indeed. Be sure to let me know from time to time how they are treating you. One of the hut boys just received his Christmas parcel, needless to say there is great joy, everybody is eating lollies. Very sorry indeed that the photo from the camp is no good, send it back kiddie, although I suppose it is too late now.</p>
<p>So Mrs. Don McDonald is &ldquo;some class&rdquo; that's right, she always was, keep it up, darling. Little Mac will be &ldquo;some class&rdquo; too, eh sweetheart. What would I give to be home somewhere about June, what say you dearest. So the photos from the Swiss were okay, that is good. Buy fancy saying that in one of my photos I had a cantankerous look. Not me kiddie. If I could get hold of you I&rsquo;d give you a big smack on the lips, here have it X. Very sorry to hear you had trouble with your teeth, but get them stopped, false teeth are no good darling. I suppose you wrote Mrs. Asser thanking her for the scarf. I prefer the main one of the two every time. The parcel has not arrived yet, does not matter how bad the cigars are they will be very welcomed, anything from home and especially from my darling wife is welcomed in this hole. Will keep a sharp look out every day for my darling's parcel. Write just as you like dear, your letters are not censored at all so be sure and give me all the news about yourself. I'm always thinking of you and Little Mac. Same as you I was thinking how great it will be to hear the young scamp (sure to be) calling mum or dad. Of course I can guess what your dream was about wait till I come back then&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>You used the word d&hellip;. could not write it, very surprised but you are right it is worse than a d&hellip;war. The mail does not close for a couple of days so will continue this later tomorrow, going to bed now. Have not got you love to sleep with, so I do the same as you, take your photos with me. Good night darling love and kisses to my dear wife with a strong embrace. XXXXXXXX</p>
<p>Well dear another day over and nothing very startling.</p>
<p>Out riding this afternoon also received another pay of 1/-/-. Plenty of money for the present time. Saw the new Moon just a little while ago, of course had a wish. You can bet you're sweet life what it was. Have wrapped up a paper to send to dad and the soon as I finish this letter will drop a line to mum. I'm writing this in the YMCA ,&ldquo;Y Emma&rdquo; as it is known by the boys. Have not heard anything of Keith yet, I suppose he will soon reach this side.</p>
<p>Wrote a letter to Nelly Fry the other day.</p>
<p>Well dear wife I will now say au revoir. The next mail closes on 29 January so will write again before that. Love and kisses to my dear little wifey.</p>
<p>Your ever own and loving husband</p>
<p>Don
</p>
<p>PS I started numbering my letters but forgot a number so left it off. Don't think it is necessary for me to number the letters as they are sure to arrive at there destination.</p>
<p>Love and kisses</p>
<p>Hubby
</p>
<p>How is little Max getting on?</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Received your very welcomed letter dated 11th of November about a fortnight ago. I'm still going strong in this camp although things are very unsettled this week. Hundreds have been warned for draft. We are only supposed to remain here three weeks, then overseas, but of course these orders can be twisted when one is in the know. Anyhow my time for leaving may come any day. </p>
<p>Keith is in England at present on 14 days leave. We have been together for a few hours. I've just returned from a week trip to Edinburgh. Keith was to have come with me but somehow he was nowhere to be seen when the train was due to leave. </p>
<p>Scotland is a great place and needless to say I had the time of my life. Visited all places of interest including Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, St Giles&rsquo; Cathedral, Forth Bridge etc etc. Went to Leith and saw a naval ship building yard. The trip up the Firth of Forth was very fine. Also had a day and night in London. Looking forward to my next leave, Scotland will do me. </p>
<p>Love to all. Hope all are okay. Love to Neita and Bubs.</p>
<p>Your sincere son-in-law Don</p>

<p>My darling wife and funny son</p>
<p>Well kiddie it's over a week since I've written, very sorry, but I'm sure you'll forgive me when I tell you all. Last Sunday week I received a wire from  Keith stating that he was in Blighty on 14 days leave and that he was coming out to the camp on the Monday. He put in an appearance about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Cannot tell you how pleased I was to see him, he is looking grand, never saw him looking better. After a good talk we went for a walk up to see George. You ought to have seen the look on George's face when Jerry went up to him. They had so much to say that they did not know where to start. After another talk we returned to our hut had supper, then turned into bed together. It .was the early hours in the morning before we got to sleep. Jerry has been having the time of his life in France, does not wish to come back to England, says France will do him. Early next morning he left the London where he expected to have a good time. Darling I've just returned from a weeks trip to Edinburgh. Had the time of my life. Keith was coming up with me, had to meet me last Thursday night at the station, intending to go up together, but very sorry to say he failed to put in an appearance. Anyhow I went on without him, expecting him up next day, but up to the present I've not heard another word from him. He must be having a good time somewhere, suppose he's got a girl somewhere. Kiddie is a great place, the Scotch people grand. I stopped at the Crown Hotel as soon as the people knew my name they could not do enough for me. Visited all places of interest, Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, Giles Cathedral, and up to the top of the Scots monument etc etc. Have a number of postcards which of course dear I'll send along. On Sunday I went for a trip up the Firth of Forth. The bridge is wonderful. While there saw the &ldquo;Australia and New Zealand&rdquo;. They had just come in from the North Sea for a 14 day overhaul. Went to all the theatres to be sure. Always had a &lsquo;box&rsquo; did things in grand style. I knocked about with two Scotch commercial travellers, who had nothing to do, so took me around. Scotland will do me kiddie. Wait darling till I take it you and Bonny Bubs for a trip to Scotland. Returned to London yesterday morning, had the day there, went to the theatre in the afternoon and witnessed &ldquo;The Maid of the Mountains&rdquo; simply glorious. Returned to camp this morning, so dear I'm dead tired. Made several attempts while on leave to write but as  sure as I&rsquo;d start my mates would get hold of me and take me out. They would not let me pay for a thing. If I attempted to pay they would go crook, gave me a royal time, and fine chaps they were. But  had fought in France and had got their discharge.</p>
<p>Darling I bought Bubs a mug made out of the real Scottish horn and Silver mounted will post it  in a day or so. Sweetheart I&rsquo;d have  given all I possess, could I have had my two darlings with me, what a grand time we would have had. Never mind wait until I return then things will be doing, eh kiddie. Enclosing a couple of postcards. While away on leave, a number lost their jobs, but yours truly, is still going strong. Great alterations are taking place in camp. Everybody is wondering who will be next. Will write again in a day or so giving more particulars of my trip. </p>
<p>How is darling Bubs getting on and how is wifey dear. Sincerely hope both are just okay. Love kisses and embraces to my two darlings from your ever own loving hubby and father with scores and scores of kisses and embraces.   </p>
<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, Don</p>

<p>The Australian mail closes tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock so will therefore write a few lines. Still at the same camp of which there is nothing to tell you except that it is still cold, bitterly cold. Yesterday and today, a very strong wind has been blowing. If you send any papers make them up like a parcel for if tied in the usual way they will not be delivered. Only yesterday two large baskets of papers belonging to some of the men were burnt.</p>
<p>Of course I would like some Mercury&rsquo;s so wrap them parcel shape. On Friday I received a very nice letter from Mrs. S Smith. Of course she wants me to go and spend my leave with her. Cannot do that but will most certainly call and see her and possibly stay one night. Will send you a copy of the letter for you to read my dear. Yesterday I also received a letter from Nellie Fry. She wants me to go there  as soon as I get off. She explained how I could get there and what sort of time they would give me. Also I am to call her cousin. She said she was writing to Mr. Hemsley  telling him that I am here, also she wrote to her brother-in-law George Davis   (she gave me his address as well) who is in Lark Hill camp.</p>
<p>Number one I intended going to see Mr Hemsley this afternoon, but yesterday I went for a walk and just as I got back he walked into the hut. We were together for about three hours, had supper together. He is in the motor transport hut, but his right leg met with an accident so that he expects to get his discharge sooner or later.   I suppose you have heard all about him, aged 40, married, two children girls ages 10 and 12. He told me all about Goudhurst and  how they would enjoy my visit. Of course have decided to go there and drive from there to Mrs. Smith. He and George met several times and he said that George looked the picture of health. Nellie Fry had a letter from George the other day. He had been in the trenches and out and was going in again. </p>
<p>When we are to get our leave, nobody knows, don't think we will ever get it, but when we do I am off to the hop District, Goudhurst, after what I was told last night. Yesterday afternoon spent a very good time at Figheldean. It is a village about 2 miles from here. The items of interest were Longfellow&rsquo;s well known chestnut tree and blacksmith shop. Had my photos taken under the tree also had a good look at the shop. The church is opposite where is marked the exact position the blacksmiths daughter sang. Outside is his grave. After having a good look round the village we had afternoon tea which was great.  I bought a couple of postcards which I will send you, they will give you an exact idea of the place. </p>
<p>Tucker is the chief thing here, last night came across a good spot, two sausages with plenty of peas and potatoes also a cup of tea for 9p. Ink has just run out will get some more tomorrow. Have been going hard all day intended to do a little study regarding the signals but could not get five minutes to myself. Have been making numerous inquiries regarding the signal business over at the front from men who have been over there. They reckon it is the best job over there but that only applies to the artillery.</p>
<p>Well darling wife will now say au revoir until next letter which I will write in a few days. How are you and how is little Mac? Sincerely hope you are going along swimmingly. I am keeping in the best of health. Remember me to all. Love to all at home and Wadhurst. </p>
<p>Love, kisses and embraces to my darling wife from your own true hubby.</p>
<p>Tons of kisses</p>
<p>Don
</p>
<p>I am enclosing the letter received, will have to destroy it after a while so I think it would be better in your hands dearest. Love to self and Little Mac from hubby and father. Eh what. Eh what.</p>

<p>Camp life is just the same all fatigues. For the present I am a bit better off, being in the signal school. The weather is still bitterly cold, ice everywhere, a great number of the water pipes have burst. Had snow today, you can imagine my dear marching out through the snow to do the signal work, we thoroughly enjoyed it. The days are getting longer which is just what we want. </p>
<p>Had a letter from Lieut. Col. Beardsmore the other day, nothing very much in it, but said he had received a letter from his wife saying that I was here and also that Keith would be arriving shortly. He wants me to call and see him as soon as I arrive in France. Tonight I received a letter from my cousin or auntie (don&rsquo;t know the relationship for certain) Annie E Roberts. She gave me a surprise it was news, it was this, that Keith was in France. Cannot make it out. This is what she said &ldquo;I heard Keith is in France and had met Eric Roberts one of my brothers boys etc, There is a bit more about Keith when over here meeting her two brothers. The two brothers have since died. Her brother Tom and family now live in London. &#8232;Keith also met them so she wants me to call and see them. It is a fairly long letter the main point is asking me to be sure and spend my leave with her at her home at Bournemouth. As for  leave I don't think there is much chance of getting it but if we do where am I going to spend it? Have five places to stay and they are all very particular that I must go to their homes and spend my whole time with them. Not going to worry for the present. Will decide when we get the leave if ever we do.Going to write tomorrow to Annie  Roberts and ask her if she has Keith&rsquo;s  address. Fancy hearing about him from her. </p>
<p>About cooking fish why dear you make my mouth water would give all I have to be with you cooking fish, as you say darling wait until we go to the Hawkesbury, then you will have to cook for three dear.  Had a great feeling today that I would like to be taking a trip to the caves like we did last year darling, how about you dear when I get back we&rsquo;ll make the pace. This is letter number 8 that I received last night. Keep your writing up darling it is simply grand to get letters from my dear little wife, makes one feel that I'm not so very far away from home and wife. </p>
<p>As to the name of our heir to be well the boys name is okay in fact so is the girls. You asked my opinion dear well as for Novak it is not bad, did not think that name was a favorite of yours but I could  not suggest another. Girls names strange to me now, this life makes it hard to think there are girls. Novak is alright sweetheart but if I think of another I like better I&rsquo;ll tell you in a following letter. But dear wife you forget you only mentioned names of one boy and one girl, what if it's twins two boys or two girls, got you now, in case the most likely happens, I am sure it will, think of some more names dear.  What a youngster, the best ever, could not be otherwise. Round about 27th June will be dates for me to look forward to. What say you sweetheart. </p>
<p>Well dear wife I&rsquo;ll now ring off there is no more news will write again before the next mail closes which is on 5th February. Going to make a piece of toast and then go to bed. Au revoir to my darling wife with love and embraces from your own loving husband. </p>
<p>Tons of kisses.</p>

<p>I posted you a letter yesterday but as there is another mail tomorrow I will write a few lines. They is no news but a  line or 2 won&rsquo;t go amiss will they kiddie.</p>
<p>I started off calling you my little wife but I suppose you are getting bigger now  like a whale.</p>
<p>There is a lot of talk about a number of signalers going to a school in another camp right down in the south. Sincerely hope I am one to be sent, it will only be a case of luck who is sent. We are all waiting for the names to come out 25 of our men are to get their disembarkation leave next week and waiting now for the officer to come in and take our names. Four out of 6 men in our hut are to get leave so I stand a good chance. It is bitterly cold today unbearable, snow still lying about. Walking down the YMCA  steps tonight slipped on the ice came a cropper but did not get hurt.</p>
<p>We are getting starved, there&rsquo;s sure to be trouble if things don&rsquo;t improve. Anyhow I had a good tea; peas, potatoes and sausages for the sum of 1/2. Food is getting very scarce in England. Kiddie tell them at home I could not possibly write to them by this mail, too busy so if there is anything to tell you can do so sweetheart. What about doing some washing for me, have plenty to do, can't get time to do it. Not like the Warrens cannot throw it over the fence here and get my wife to do it anyhow you will have plenty of washing to do when little Mac comes along, what do you say darling. Every afternoon I attend a riding school, have to have 14 lessons to complete the course. In my next letter I hope to be able to write all about my four days leave. Sincerely hope you are in the best of health, how is the little darling getting on sweetheart. Be sure and tell me all. Remember me to all. Love and kisses to my darling wife from your most loving and sincere husband,  Don</p>
<p>Catch these dear XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>This is Wednesday morning. After I got to bed last night received a Mercury, evening news posted by mum needless to say I read every word. It was so grand to get the old paper. No doubt you'll receive this later about 18 March so will now wish you many happy returns of the day. As soon as I go on leave will buy something for my dear and post same straight away. I'll be home for your next birthday kiddie also for little Mac&rsquo;s too. We will have a good bust upon that day kiddie.
My hands are like ice it's absolutely the coldest day since we arrived. </p>
<p>Love and kisses to my darling wife. </p>
<p>Your loving husband.</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>London the greatest and largest city of the world was visited by yours truly last weekend and had a glorious time as far as sightseeing was concerned. Had my 4 days disembarkation leave Friday Saturday Sunday and Monday. Only 25 men were allowed to leave so considered myself very lucky to be among that number. When the others get leave, well nobody knows. Four of us went together E Hewitt, J Allison, W Crowley and your hubby. Had a car engaged for Friday morning 6:30, he failed to put in an appearance so had to walk to the Amesbury station about 4 miles in distance.</p>
<p>On the way of course stopped and had a cup of tea which I can assure you was thoroughly enjoyed. Caught the  train at 9.05 am and after a grand trip through snow-covered country arrived at the &ldquo;great smoke&rdquo;, Waterloo station at 12 noon. We then caught a tube to Trafalgar Square, arriving there in a few minutes. To see us walking along The Strand you would have thought we were children we acted like kids overly pleased with themselves, to think we were in civilization again and away from the D&hellip; Camp. Eventually we arrived at the Strand Palace Hotel, postcards of which I have sent you. It's a very fine place, tariff reasonable compared with Sydney. It was full of Australian officers, in fact officers are all you see in London, they are having a jolly good time. Mrs. Crowley and sisters are staying at this hotel, so when we arrived can you imagine the meeting between Mr. and Mrs. Crowley, of course you can, just fancy if it were we two kiddie, never mind darling we will have a better meeting the three of us eh kiddie. After lunch we went to the bank for one of the boys and then went out to see Wally Gillies at his sisters place. He was very well and expected to sail the next morning. Suppose you heard of the Port Nicholson being sunk, she went down the day after leaving Devenport on her way to London. Wally and Charlie Nicholson intended going round to London on her  but changed their minds at the last moment very lucky they were, don't you think. Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s home is a very fine place, two-storey and in the center of large grounds. Have three cars all are in use for patriotic purposes. Mrs. Smith is a very nice woman indeed. When I go to France she wants me to write and she will send me over papers, fruit etc.</p>
<p>After spending a very enjoyable time there we made it back to the hotel.  I intended going to the theater after tea. While speaking to the Crowleys they mentioned they had booked seats for &ldquo;Puss in  Boots&rdquo; so asked me to go with them which I did. After a great deal of trouble persuaded Miss King (Mrs. Crowley's sister) to accept my money for the extra seat 12/6. Found out the next day they were treating the boys, of course  being away all afternoon did not know anything about this business. Anyhow would sooner pay for myself. The prices very high at the theaters there is a tax which has also to be paid. By the time you get home from the theater, that is sitting in the front seats costs every person at least one pound. The panto (pantomime) was at Drury Lane Theatre, very cool indeed, all that I wished was that you could be we me dear. After the show, had supper in the winter garden at the hotel. It is a very fine winter garden I can assure you, the postcard gives a faint idea what it is like. Electric lights are everywhere. On Saturday after a good sleep between sheets started off by myself to see London. Just I went to the Commonwealth offices and then took a stroll along the Strand to Trafalgar Square then to Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Square etc. then made for the East End.
While strolling along met one of the boys, J Allison  so off we went to Buckingham palace passing numerous arches, buildings and monuments of great historic importance (both past and present). Luck seemed to be with us, while passing a very large building and being anxious to know what it was I asked a man walking along. To make a long story short he asked us if we would like to be shown around, of course we said yes, so he volunteered to do so. He was a returned soldier, fought at Mons, got his discharge 10/- a week for three years. He is going, out to Australia shortly, the British government giving him a free passage.  A butcher by trade. Viewed Buckingham Palace, Queen Victoria's monument, passed through R&eacute;gent Park, Hyde Park, Rotten Row viewed the Duke of Wellington's home and Memorial, Albert's memorial and went inside the great Royal Albert Hall. Prior to this went passed by all the military and naval buildings, there appears to be hundreds. Afterwards we went to Whitehall where again military and naval buildings are in galore. After having a look at the largest business houses made it back by tube to lunch. It was a great morning, having somebody to show us around made things very easy. After lunch the four of us and Mrs. Crowley went to St Mary&rsquo;s and then to St. Paul's. There is no need for me to go into detail about St Paul&rsquo;s. Made a thorough inspection, especially down in the vaults. It was grand, the only thing wrong was that time was too short. Then we made off to the Tower had an exterior view on this occasion, went over Tower and London bridges and then had tea. Talk about eat, we just did, of course the food was slightly different from the camp food hey what E Hewitt. D Mc Call (of whom I will tell you later) and myself witnessed &ldquo;Chu Chin Chow&rdquo; at His Majesties theater that night played ( should read produced and directed ) by my Oscar Asche. It was simply great. On the occasion it cost us only 2/8,  2/6 and 2 tax though had to stand up. All play houses in London are packed every night, simply wonderful where the money comes from. After a taxi home and a good supper got to bed. Enclosing program which may interest you.</p>
<p>Darling I'll have to ring off now just on &ldquo;lights out&rdquo; have  written five pages think that's enough for one envelope will continue the description of my leave tomorrow in another letter.</p>
<p>How are you getting on darling, how is little Mac, sincerely hope everything okay. Love to my darling wife, buck up kiddie from your own and loving husband with tons of kisses and embraces.</p>
<p>Don</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Just about to start the second half of the description of my trip to London. Suppose you have received the first letter before this, anyhow let us hope so. Sunday, 11th February. After a good nights rest, started off, Eric Hewitt and myself to Whitehall and Buckingham palace to witness the changing of the guard. It is supposed to be one of the sites of London, but at present the war has taken a lot of colour out of it. But the Horse Guards were very fine indeed. The band at the Palace was simply glorious. After paying our respects to the guard we took the fashionable Sunday morning walk through Hyde park and Rotten  Row. How you do see fashion. Close by skating was in full swing. Next had a good exterior look around parliament and Westminster Abby then made our way back to the hotel via Thames embankment. Here it was, a few yards from Cleopatra's needle, that I had a pencil sketch of myself drawn. A fit of the devil, had me I think, for me to stand two minutes on the Embankment in the one position while an old man did the terrible deed for 2p. Scores of people were enjoying themselves at my expense. Did not care a hang considering the grand results, I don't think, what say you dear, never think it was your hubby would you sweetheart. Then we visited Hotels Real and Savoy and eventually arrived back for lunch.</p>
<p>After another good fill spent an hour at the National Art Gallery. On our way there inspected a number of captured German guns in Trafalgar Square. I left Eric Hewitt at the art gallery and made off by myself to the Royal Albert Hall. He did not want to come and I was very anxious to attend the Sunday afternoon concert which I understood would be very good. Eric thought he had something better on but told me at tea that he had a rotten afternoon. As for the concert, it was simply great, mostly orchestra, but what an orchestra, over 100 strong and play, well I will never forget it, the music is still ringing in my ears. Cost to me only one shilling and two pence war tax. Will send you the program may interest you. As for the Hall itself words fail me to describe it, simply that it is the finest in the world. One item on the organ, is sufficient, to draw people scores of miles away to hear. At night Eric and I spent a few hours at the pictures. Monday our last day of leave was far the best. Made an early start E Hewlett, J Allison, a returned soldier and myself to the Tower. Here we made a very detailed inspection, naturally intensely interesting. Will not go into detail, sending two books, fully describing everything. Every thing that appears in the books were viewed by yours truly, so you can easily imagine what sort of a time we spent,. For the &ldquo;Bloody Tower&rdquo; one of the Beefeaters came with us and acted as guide. Very weird indeed. So much here for the Tower. Then we caught the tube to Westminster, arriving at the Abbey a few minutes to 12 o&rsquo;clock. Informed that a service of intercession was just about to start so attended same. This service is held every day at 12 and lasts15 minutes. Enclosing copy of service. Then for the inspection of the building  of history.
Luck was my way, a lady had a party of Canadian officers, who she was showing around, and asked me to join them, which I did, to be sure. This lady spends all her time showing soldiers around hence she knows the Abby from A-Z. Needless to say not a corner was missed. You can tell dad, he was in my mind during the whole inspection, knowing what he would give to have changed places with me. Would not have missed the Abbey for anything. London is the place to waken up ones history, taught at school. Had forgotten it all but now, never.</p>
<p>In going from one place to another in London we made sure to take the route on which there was something to see, therefore we saw every arch and monument of the great city.</p>
<p>Love Don</p>
<p>Had a mouthful, and for the last lap, we joined forces. Mr. and Mrs. Crowley, 2 Miss Kings, J Allison, and the returned soldier, E Hewitt and myself. We went to Madame Tussards another notable London&rsquo;s rendevous. Here we spent a good time, which yours truly thoroughly enjoyed. Also sending a booklet. Here again not a single thing was missed. Tea 7 pm. Up to now the four days seemed a dream, now we woke up, caught the 8:15 pm. train from Waterloo arriving at Amesbury 11:30 pm. Here luck was our way. At the station there were only three cars and about 1000 men wanting them. We got the first car and flew back to camp arriving 11:55, the end of a perfect four days. In London during the day one would never think there was a war on but at night that is a different tale to tell. Not I light to be seen, utter darkness. Theaters are the only places to go.</p>
<p>Well darling wife will now close. By the way received another letter today from Mrs. S Smith. From the text of her letters she is a fine old lady.</p>
<p>Trusting that you are in the best of health and progressing favorably, eh what kiddie. Love and embraces to my dear wife from your own loving husband with thousands of kisses.</p>
<p>Don</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Just received three of your most welcomed and loving letters, numbers 9, 10 and 11. Keep your writing up, it is the greatest pleasure for me to receive my dear wife's letters  Every night I look out for your letters. When the n.c.o. brings the mail around at night and calls out my name, to see me, you would think I was a youngster, what ever I am doing stops indefinitely. As for the photos they are great, what would I give to have been sitting next to you dear on the step, of course you understand my feelings. You seem to be in a jolly good mood, so to the rest. The house I know well, Vi and Elma look okay, but you kiddie, it brings back happy memories. Lucky people to be able to go in for a swim. No place here for swimming and the water we have is all frozen. Anyhow when I get back we two will have a great time at the Hawkesbury or somewhere else giving  little Mac a paddle. You speak of writing miserable letters, not at all Kiddie. It's always best to write what one thinks, than to write a lot of bosh. Anyhow your letters always put me in the highest joy. I got those few tears as kisses darling. You say try and get back by next June, would that I could love, for the greatest event in history, but bet your life I'll get back as soon as possible.. As for the war when we arrived it looked as if six months would do it but from news we receive straight from the front, things are not so bright and today's papers seem so too. Have spoken to a number of officers from France, they all say in their opinion that victory will come at the latter or beginning of next year, but as to what happens before, well you can imagine. </p>
<p>Your going to start and make shirts, that's grand but don't forget and make too few for there is a chance of twins&hellip;&hellip; what do I hear you say. Give us a kiss kiddie.</p>
<p>Very pleased indeed to hear that the holiday did you good, and that you are a good deal fatter, suppose you are fatter in more ways than one, now don't go off kiddie, I know you would not. </p>
<p>Had two the letters from Phyll the other day, also received a pair of socks from her. Had another letter from Mrs. S Smith in which she enclosed several sprigs of flowers, of which I'm enclosing one to you. But this is not all on Sunday, I received a parcel from England, who should it be from but her ladyship Mrs. S Smith. Contained date scones, sausage and cheese rolls. Words fail me, how pleased I was, sat down and had a feed, and then dropped her a letter straight away. It was simply grand of her don't you think darling. Here is some news for you I don't think I told you about it before. At 2 pm on November 11th, 1916 while off the Victorian coast I wrote a note and got the signatures of a number of men nearby, nobody in particular, put it into a bottle and threw it overboard. I asked the finder to send it to the &ldquo;Sydney Sun.&rdquo; Before I go any further while on the boat made friends with a married man D McCall of whom I&rsquo;ve told you. Well he got a letter from his wife the other day stating that she had the note and bottle. It was picked up at Port Philip and forwarded to the &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; and appeared in the issue 11th December 1916. Mrs. McCall saw it and being the first to call at the office took possession of it. Her husband's signature was also on it. He and I are still great friends always go about together. In her letter she asked her hubby if you kiddie had a prior right to it, if so would send it to you, but at the same time did not want to part with it. Anyhow I understand her hubby has written her telling her to send it to you but whether you are to keep it I cannot say, that rests between your two selves. But fancy it getting into her hands, we feel very pleased indeed to think that it was picked up. </p>
<p>Met Arley Eckford on Sunday. He is okay. Did not see Tom Sawyer, he was away at church, good boy. At my first opportunity I am  going up to their camp. Today I was inoculated. Last Sunday spent a good whole day at Amesbury. It's a fine little town, had meals at the George Hotel and by jove we made things look scarce. Their prices are high 2/6 and 3/-The place of greatest interest is Amesbury Abby dates back to the year 1426 rather old. This church and Abby was founded by the ancient family of Antrobus.*
This family is now wiped out the last two male members being killed in the present war. Very interesting old place. Could write pages about it. One thing might interest you. A number of ancient Queens were buried in vaults under the church and Cromwell dug up the remains and secured the lead from the coffins to make bullets. Years after, they were re-buried, of course  we had to inspect every part and can assure you we did it properly. Kiddie the books I am sending you are nothing new, but when I return and in my spare time looking through then will be able to explain many interesting things. </p>
<p>Well darling will now close hoping you are keeping the best of health. Remember me to all friends. Love to all at Charles Street also mum and dad. Please give them any news in my letters. Love iand 000 embraces to my darling wife from your own loving and sincere husband.</p>
<p>With love and kisses xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>*Antrobus&nbsp;is a name of&nbsp;ancient&nbsp;Norman origin. It arrived in England with the Norman Conquest of 1066. The&nbsp;Antrobus family&nbsp;lived in Cheshire, where they held land.</p>

<p>My dearest wife</p>
<p>How is this photo. This photo was taken in front of the post office at Durban, the nigger boy allowed himself to be included after a great deal of persuasion. He is a newsboy. This is the party that did the &lsquo;la grand&rdquo; while on leave in Durban. Here are their names Robertson, Forsythe, Cook, your hubby, Allison, Crowley, King, Mc Harq. This is an enlargement on a pocket camera. Your loving husband.</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>My dear wife</p>
<p>Another photo. Taken at the sports ground, Cape Town from the grandstand. Tug of war championship final being pulled, won by  field artillery. Yours truly is somewhere in that crowd with back to the camera but cannot be picked out. You have a good look and see if you can pick out your old man. Your loving husband.</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Going to write this letter in pencil. Please excuse me. Do not like writing in pencil, but when the ink is very low, there's nothing else for it. Received four of your loving letters today, numbers 12,13, 14 and 15. I think I told you in a previous letter that I had received 12, 13 and 14 if so my mistake.</p>
<p>Food conditions are getting very bad and after 15th things are going to be much worse. The YMCA and Salvation Army will not be allowed to sell anything which has sugar in the making, also bread, ham, and bacon are to be cut right out. How we are to get on goodness only knows, we always fill up at the YMCA etc. I suppose we will have to go without. Anyhow I don't suppose we will starve. The other day Jeff Wynne and Russell Bryon paid me a call but unfortunately I was away at Amesbury. Nevertheless I met Jeff this afternoon in the YMCA. He is okay, looking just the thing, camped only a few hundred yards away, so, also is Tom Sawyer. Thought I had Tom's address, but no. One night wrote him a letter, having no idea what part of Lark Hill he was camped on, then much to my surprise discovered that I did not have his address, so destroyed the letter.</p>
<p>All going well, will go to see him tomorrow afternoon, now that I know his camp. Received a letter from mother the other day and as you say very pleased about Keith getting home also that military life has taken much of his shyness away for which I&rsquo;m glad. Would very much like to see my dear little wife in the purple sports coat, which she made herself, by jove kiddie you are getting clever. You mentioned not having received any letters yet, it's about time you receive some kiddie but when you do receive  my Durban  mail you are sure to receive a huge pile. The postcards received are simply great especially the one with the 5 youngsters in it. Is that supposed to be an omen dear, hope not, don't mind 1, 2 or 3 but to have 5 in one go that's too much of a joke. Don't think you would like 5 kiddies on June 27th would you darling.</p>
<p>What do I hear you saying  &ldquo;nuff said&rdquo;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Christmas was spent at Dakar and sincerely hope that next year it will be spent with my dear wife and family (how many). Sometime ago you mentioned that you had sent a parcel well it has not yet come to hand, let me know about the date you posted it. Very pleased to hear that the money is being received regularly. By jove kiddie you did well for Christmas presents but not to get one from your hubby is too bad. Look darling I am very sorry indeed fully expected to get something when in London but for some reasoner which I cannot explain failed to do so. While in Amesbury last Saturday tried to get something, but unsuccessful. Anyhow sweetheart the first opportunity will purchase a Christmas box and birthday present. You will be late in receiving same, but better late than never. Cannot get anything in this camp, will have to wait until I get some more leave. You say write as often as possible, well I do kiddie every chance I get, but can assure you we have very little time to ourselves. When we do get a few hours off, we get as far away from the camp as possible. You keep your writing up too dear, for it is the only thing I look forward to. Waiting anxiously every night for the mail to come along. Have a good mail service here now especially newspapers. My word I did laugh when 
I read you did not having enough wind, but little Mac will have enough wind or noise, that's if he takes after his father, says you. Fancy being called &lsquo;mum and dad&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t be fancy but reality very soon. You did have an exciting trip to Uralla and from what you say, very lucky in indeed to get home safe and sound. You had better not take any more trips to Uralla. Do take care of your self. Very pleased to hear you are keeping in the best of health I am getting fat. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay. Tons of love and kisses to my darling wife from your loving husband with kisses and embraces.</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>Tons and tons of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   Love Don</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Just after getting to bed last night I received your most loving and welcomed letter No 20.
2 and 4 are still missing I think they must have gone astray.</p>
<p>My thoughts were exactly the same as yours dear, the day I arrived. While on the water it did not seem that we were too far away but as soon as we landed there was a different tale to tell, seemed as if there were worlds between us. Anyhow we were thankful to arrive okay, found out later that during the last two days of the journey, two submarines had been sunk very close to our course. Regarding the cable, no doubt it caused you some amusement but I addressed it such:-Mrs. D McDonald  &#8453; McDonald's auctioneer etc. You say you will have to wait another six weeks for more of my letters, no this will not be the case as I posted a very large mail at Cape Town. As to camp life there is nothing to tell, only that our food supply is to be cut down again and after the 15th the YMCA and Salvation Army will not be allowed to sell anything to the soldiers which contains sugar in the making. Don't know how we are going to get on then, it's bad enough now goodness only knows.</p>
<p>This afternoon I visited camp number 11 and met a number of Maitland boys; Tom Sawyer who was okay, Len Hann, you remember this lad, George brought him to Charles Street several times, Ross Johnson of Lorn, looking well, Russell Brown, Harley Ekford and Ted Spinney. There were a number of other Maitland boys in camp but did not have time to look them up. Fancy Tom and Harley Eckford saw me at Dakar, also Ross Johnson, they called out to me but failed to make themselves heard. Of course they  came along on the same convoy. They told me that George was okay while in camp and the night of his departure for France he was as happy as Larry. You may know this, if not it will certainly interest you, Russell Brown told me the boat he and George came over on, owing to the rough weather on the last few days of the journey lost trace of their escort, so therefore they were at the mercy of the submarines. Well one day one officer fell overboard and the boat stopped to pick him up. While this was going on, another boat just ahead of them was sent to the bottom. To all the boys, they consider the rough weather saved them without doubt.</p>
<p>Did not see Ken Spinney. He was very ill coming over but pulled through okay under the care of Dr Major Pintand an old Maitland doctor. </p>
<p>Well darling wife there is no more  news to tell. Sincerely hope you keep eating in the best of health and bucking up for the end of June. Be sure and cable me sweetheart particulars after the greatest event in history has taken place. Tons and tons of kisses to my darling wife from your loving hubby with kisses and embraces without end xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>Going to drop Vi  a line now.</p>
<p>Au revoir for the present sweetheart.  Don</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Every day this week there has been a delivery of Australian mail to the boys but yours truly received none, until tonight when darling I was overjoyed in receiving 9 letters 4 from my little wife, one your father, one  Don&rsquo;s and the remainder from home, simply great. The numbers of your letters darling were 24, 25, 28, and 30. Will answer number 24 tonight the others in a day or so.</p>
<p>Yesterday 12 April was officially the first day of summer. It snowed all morning and rained in the afternoon a good opening for summer, I don't think. Give me hot weather before cold. Australian weather will do me, no matter how hot. Last night after tea I went for a stroll and on the way back to camp make Ray Prior and Herbert Mannall. Ray is looking well. We got speaking about doings of Maitland, of course he told me he got married before leaving, how he wished it to be a small  and quiet affair, and it turned out a big &ldquo;do&rdquo;. He has grown a mustache which in my opinion does not improve him although I did not tell him that.</p>
<p>Darling you have not mentioned having received my Cape Town letters. You may have done so in the letters that are still missing. I left to be posted a very large batch of letters. You say you wonder what I do on weekends, well several of us go on walking trips to the different villages. But I would sooner be back with you darling and the children ( as you say) it would be glorious but sweetheart the day for my return is getting closer then we will have the time of our lives eh kiddie. Won't it be grand to see mum and dad and the children out for a walk on Sunday  afternoons. Don't mention it. Guess the Matar would be excited but I would like to know what the boss has to say, wait until he is called &ldquo;Grandfather&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s no tommy twaddle at all dearest, I like to hear everything in detail, why shouldn't I, so keep going kiddie give everything (about the greatest child that was ever born) to me in absolute detail. Not too much about the &ldquo;camping coat&rdquo;. I am extremely pleased to hear that you are keeping in the best of health, it&rsquo;s simply grand to hear that my dear wife never felt better in her life.</p>
<p>Mrs. Crowley is boarding at Durrington about one and a half miles from here, her hubby goes and has tea with her every night. Lucky beggar. Have not received your photos yet dear, sincerely how it hurries up, will be anxiously waiting for every mail to get my dear wife's photo. Like yourself we have no idea when the mail goes, so just post the letters and chance the mail. Have not received the parcel yet. I received a letter from Keith today making arrangements for our meeting tomorrow. But I am afraid I will be doing a little duty tomorrow, with good luck I will get out of it. He mentioned having received your letter also that he had a great time while on leave. Next Tuesday is the day set aside for the inspection by the king. We don't care a hang about the review, what we care about is the four day leave which we hope to get. If we get the leave, the money, darling, which you sent along will certainly come in handy, will ensure me a jolly good time.</p>
<p>It's bitterly cold and no fire so kiddie, I think I will turn in. Very pleased indeed to hear you are keeping in good health and everything is progressing okay, towards the day of the great event. Keep in good health darling and then nobody need worry and everything will be just the thing. Au revoir to my sweetheart and wife we tons and tons of kisses from your ever own and loving husband with kisses and embraces.</p>

<p>Have just read through your letter number 25 again. Kiddie it is far too cold for the silk pyjamas and by jove if I were at home with you dear I&rsquo;d try sleeping with less than silk pyjamas, bet your life, and I know that you would not mind. The arrangements for the great event about June 24th are okay and I am sure everything will turn out alright. The oak bedstead will be just the thing and when I return&rdquo;what oh&rdquo; the bed. It will be simply grand sleeping again in a decent big with my dear little wife besides me and in the morning the youngsters crawling all over us. What say you kiddie. That will be the time. Yes dear they'll have to be another first night, and what a night it will be, also another honeymoon, to be sure.</p>
<p>Have broken into the 10 pounds buying food and on my first opportunity will get my photo taken. Will have to wait until I get to London or some other large town. Your photo and parcel have not arrived yet, suppose they will come along due course and anyhow I sincerely hope so.</p>
<p>Yesterday I met Keith again, we had a very good afternoon together. Visited Durrington**  and Figheldean.*  After he left and returned to camp I went to Durrington and had tea, met one of the boys, (D McCall) and went to church. The church was packed, nearly all soldiers. This singing was grand nearly carried the roof off. Keith has received your letter also one from George. George was okay his letter was dated ninth June. Yesterday we witnessed an airplane come down. The pilot made difficulties at  a height of 2000 feet. He then attempted to &ldquo;plane&rdquo; it to earth but when he was about 1000 feet up one wing buckled. He then took a header to earth. The noise when it struck earth could be heard for miles away. It landed about 1 1/2 miles from our camp. Keith and I had a look at the wreckage. Simply a mess of splinters. The airman who was on his own, died 10 minutes after being picked up. That was absolutely no hope for him.</p>
<p>Darling I'll have to ring off. Will have to set to and get things ready for tomorrows &ldquo;Royal Review&rdquo;. Will write again in a day or so. i am keeping in good health, and feeling fit. Extremely pleased to hear you are the same.  Keep your pecker up darling, everything will be okay for the great event. Take care of yourself and little Mac until I return which I don't think will be very long. Love and kisses to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband with millions and millions of kisses.</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Your letter on 4 February 1917 found  me last Friday and I was of course please to hear from you again, any old news from home is always appreciated. We have been here almost 7 weeks now, but expect to be moved at any time now and as a matter of fact there is a healthy rumour to the effect that we move on Monday next. So far we have had an awfully decent time much better than anticipated and it is bothering the officers, what to do with us, to fill the time. We are never up before 8 o'clock and then we would not get out only breakfast is brought down. I have made the breakfast call my reveille. On Sunday I went over to Bulford to meet Don, we went for a stroll and had an afternoon tea together. Don told me he would be going to Salisbury on Saturday. Jim Kerr, wishing to see Don is going to Salisbury on Saturday also and he has arranged for Bob Kerr to be there, so I will try to get to Salisbury also, it is almost 2 years since I have seen Bob, he and I were pals for years. George wrote me last week and it appears by the tone of his letter to be okay. </p>
<p>Neita you know how much I care for writing, so will now bring the business to a close. </p>
<p>Best of luck. Keith</p>

The car we arranged to get broke down, we managed to get another and a lady driver, of course we were awfully annoyed. As we six had some knowledge of cars, the girl handed the whole business over to us. She was a good judge too, for we only had three punctures going to Bornemouth. We left camp at 11 AM and drew up at the Pier Hotel Bournemouth at 2 o'clock for dinner. We flew around the city for a few hours see all that was worth seeing. We left at 11 PM and arrived in camp at the respectable hour of 2.00 AM. The  girl had to go to Andover, another 10 miles.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>We are present in the position when the Germans and British started the great &ldquo;Somme&rdquo; battle last year. There are very few inhabitants about, soldiers billeted in a lot of the ruins. Last Monday at 8 AM we left out old camp, caught the train and after a journey through the beautiful scenery of France arrived at our first stop at 2:30 PM. Here we detrained and witnessed for the first time a ruined town caused by German shells, words fail to describe the damage done. Matched from the station to a rest camp about one mile distant, here tea was provided and after a rest we marched to our present position about 4 miles. As soon as we arrived we took up our positions in billets. These billets are old sheds, stables, and remnants of houses. I turned in to bed straight away. The bed consistent of wire stretched over two beams, but a good bed all the same. Soon got to sleep but found out that I was not all alone,  rats  &ldquo;oh what rats they were&rdquo; running all over me, jumping from the beams onto yours truly. While half asleep one ran across my face, but too tired to worry. When I woke in the morning discovered that the rats had beaten holes in my tucker bag and eaten a number of biscuits, of course I ate the rest, no matter how many mouths had been at them. Viewed the ruins during the morning, also the church, very fine indeed. At night I attended a concert given by&rdquo;The Anzac Coves&rdquo;, was not too bad at all. Wednesday morning had I look at the old trenches used by the British including the first dressing station used by the British in this sector. Then took a walk into this hut &ldquo;The Army Hut&rdquo; and who should I meet but Billy Foster of East Maitland. Spent the whole day together, giving one and other all the news. Had dinner together and went to the pictures act night. Bill is just back from leave in &ldquo;Blighty&rdquo;. Can assure you we thoroughly enjoyed one anothers company. We are both in the military and in the same division. I'm going to try and get in his battery. I was the first Maitlander he had seen for a very long time. While we were walking along the street we met a young chap, I know well from Farley by the name of Armstrong, of course you can well imagine how pleased we all were each of us wanted to know all the latest news of home and to be sure we each had some to give. This morning I met Bill again had a few hours together including a sing song in this hut. Bully beef and biscuits is all we have been able to get to eat but  for dinner today we made some stew and by jove it was grand, keeping some for tea. Have no idea how long we will be here, have not joined our division yet  BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB</p>
<p>from here and when we do it's very likely to be   BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB*</p>
<p>Dearest I have not received a letter since arriving in France and goodness knows when I will get them now, soon as we settle down,  I will write to headquarters and give them my address. Kiddie I will write as often as possible but conditions here do not facilitate writing anyhow dear you can rest assure I will do my best.</p>
<p>This morning while I was away from my rat hole at a young chap from East Maitland by the name of Everingham called to see me. There are several boys in their family so do not know for certain which one it was, no doubt he will call again. </p>
<p>The weather here is grand, beautiful sunshine. This town we are in was the scene of very heavy fighting, this is clearly visible, after a walk around. It's only a matter of four months since the last shells landed in the place.</p>
<p>Well my dear there's very little to write about so will say au revoir for the present. How are you getting on, just okay I hope. Getting very anxious waiting for the cable, have not got to wait long now, eh kiddie. I'm okay, do not worry, there is absolutely no need for it.</p>

<p>My darling wife</p>
<p>Since arriving in our present position we have had plenty of work to do in fact the hardest work I have done  since being in uniform so therefore have had very little time to write. No letters since arriving in France but now that I have settled down they should be putting in an appearance. The town we were billeted in we left last Friday at 9:30 AM a short march indeed, joining up with our division at 10 AM. Our division has been doing some very heavy fighting and are now out for a few weeks well earned rest. Soon as we reach the camp we were &hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>It is with deepest regret that I write expressing my sincere sympathy to you dear, mother, father and family also Vi in the loss you have all sustained in Frank being killed in action on April 4th.
I first heard this sad news from Nelly Fry about a fortnight ago, did not mention anything in my letters until I received some definite information. Nellie said she was not certain if it wasy true so I wrote straight away to Australian headquarters and to hids O.C. asking for particulars. Up to the present no word have I received from them. Sid Fry told Hilton Hain that it was true and yesterday I saw Frank&rsquo;s name in the &ldquo;Anzac&rdquo; paper list. The same old trouble appeared in connection with his name, the letter B was omitted sincerely hope there is a mistake. I will do everything in my power to get any information which might interest you, have already asked several of the boys who have gone up to the particular locality where he was killed to try and get some information.
Kiddie words fail me to express my feelings for you. It must have been a great shock but I&rsquo;m sure you bare the shock equally as as well, as you did on the previous occasion. Can easily understand what a trying time you would have had especially as you had more than yourself to consider.</p>
<p>It is a great shame that Frank could not have pulled through but darling you can rest assured he died a hero's death fighting with the finest army in the field &ldquo;The Australians&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Express my greatest sympathy to mother and father and Vi and you dear kiddie accept your husband&rsquo;s sincere sympathy. Keep your heart up dear one.</p>
<p>From your ever own and loving husband with kisses.</p>

<p>Wrote you a letter yesterday and as promised making an attempt to write another today. There is absolutely no news kiddie but of course a few lines will be welcomed eh dear. The weather has been very hot indeed so the boys have taken the opportunity at every spare moment of having a swim. I have had my share, it's just great. The place where we swim is a gully which was flooded by the French some 10 months ago to stem the German advance. On Tuesday our division was inspected by General Birdwood nothing sensational happened, but the boys made a very good showing. Had a heavy thunderstorm this afternoon, cleared the air. Therefore it is much cooler tonight. I am badly off for letters, have not received any Australian mail yet, rather disappointed, butt as we expect to be remaining in our present position for a couple of weeks it is therefore on the cards that's all I will receive some of my loves own letters before we move. Have not heard from Nellie Fry lately. I wonder if Goudhurst was one off the towns bombed, sincerely hope not. By her letter she seemed to be afraid that their district would stop a few bombs, in fact zepps had passed over their house on several occasions. We are not as well off for meals as in the base camp but it is not too bad considering the conditions. Every night before going to bed, we make a fire and give ourselves a treat of cocoa and cake. Can assure you cocoa, condensed milk etc. is very scarce. But what would I give darling to be able to be in the old kitchen with you kiddie making our supper together. They were grand times eh kiddie, won&rsquo;t it be great when we are able to do so again. Will have to make it for three then, I suppose little Mac will have a good appetite. Hope he likes scrambled eggs on toast. Well sweetheart this month is moving on. Only about three weeks to go and I will be like a cat on  hot bricks waiting for the joyous news. Won't be responsible for my actions, when I get the cable. Won't get drunk, that's impossible here, but I'll be intoxicated with excitement. I posted you a few postcards the other day, have some more which I will send from time to time. The town close to our camp has a very fine church which was subjected to a heavy bombardment 12 months ago. The statue on top of the tower has been knocked but has not fallen down. It appears as if it would fall any minute. The story goes that as soon as this statue falls the war ends. I heard this in Australia it appeared in all the newspapers. But it has been wired up securely so the chances of it falling is a very remote. So if this story were true, the war would never end. So you can see how ridiculous this story is. From what we can see the end is not in sight, but when it does happen don't think the authorities will be able to hold the Australians. Everyone is talking about getting their discharge on this side and having a good time. You can rest assured kiddie I will get home by the shortest and quickest way to my darling wife and &ldquo;ours&rdquo;. The cocoa is just being prepared so will have to get in for my cut. From where I am sitting at present I can see miles of trenches. These are both German and British trenches which were used about 10 months ago. Today I had a job of filling in some old dugouts, dugouts are everywhere, in fact we are thinking of using one for our home.</p>
<p>8th June</p>
<p>Today kiddie I received a postcard from Flo Roberts also two letters concerning Frank. One from headquarters which does not contain anything of importance and one from his unit which I am enclosing. If I should be in the district where he was buried you can rest assured I will do everything which you all at Charles Street would like to have done. I wrote you the other day letting you know how I first got the news.</p>
<p>Will now ringing off sweetheart. Keep your pecker up, all will be well. I am okay. Hope my dear one is keeping in good health. Au revoir to my dear wife your ever own and loving husband with tons and tons of kisses.</p>
<p>Don</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>In my last letter I mentioned having received your loving letter number 41. It was simply grand to receive your letter after such a long spell without news. Now that the mail has started to arrive I should get my share. Sincerely hope you received the letter containing particulars of Frank. There is absolutely no news to write about. We are still camped in that position where we joined our division. The huts  we occupy are called the &ldquo;dog leg&rdquo; huts, rather a flash name eh what. Weather is grand, just like our Australian weather, at times it is very hot but the nights are generally cool. The days are very long, daylight from 3:30AM to 10PM. Can easily read the paper at 10 o'clock at night. Very pleased kiddie to know that you are receiving my letters okay. Sincerely hope you receive the album of photos. It was registered so should reach you safely. There is no chance of getting photos here. But where it is possible I get postcards of the country through which we have passed. Received a letter from Keith the other day. He is having a grand time, plays football instead of drill, but like all good things he says it gets tiresome, now he wants to move to another camp. Will be anxiously looking out for your parcel sweetheart, anything in the eatable line iIs more than welcome. Yes the national party had a great win, the boys on this side voted the right way. Fancy the mata* canvassing for votes. She is getting younger every day, the giddy old sport. She was well rewarded for her work. </p>
<p>It was amusing being called a nice girl, but it's a fact, you were always and will be a nice and good girl eh dear. Well how is little Mac getting on, suppose by the time you receive this  letter, he will be a fair scamp giving you any amount off work, keeping you awake at night, kicking up a terrible row. What would I give darling to be with you now and for the next couple of weeks. But such cannot be the case, but you can bet your sweet life yours truly will get home as soon as possible to my dear wife and little one. The mail has just come in, but none for yours truly. Couple of the boys had received parcels. What I'm looking and waiting for is the cable five suppose I'll have to wait until the end of the month. Today we received our weekly issue of tobacco. The cigarettes I gave to one of the boys, I do not smoke cigarettes, the tobacco was bad so had to throw it away anyhow I got some Captain from one of the boys. The pipe keeps me company it's a good friend out in these parts. Our suppers are still going strong. Hard times. they call it. This is what we generally have for supper, cocoa and currant cake with about half ian inch of strawberry jam on it. Does not go too bad.</p>
<p>Well darling will now say au revoir with scores and scores of kisses to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband.</p>

<p>My darling wife</p>
<p>Our division is still out resting and the boys are having a grand time. The weather is very hot so therefore indulge twice a day in a good swim. This life would do us for the duration of the war. Last Monday I was transferred from the DAC the 15th Battery AFA AIF France. That is my new address. Have not heard from Nellie Fry lately. It won&rsquo;t be long now that I'll receive your letters re-addressed by her. Every time I change my address I notify Nellie straight away. I am on the battery staff of the 15th battery. Well kiddie had a grand time last Thursday. Leave for the day. Let camp about 7.30 am and walked to a station about one and a half miles distant where I caught the train arriving at about 9:45 AM. The fare was very reasonable 5 p Second class single. Had a good look around the city, viewed the magnificent cathedral etc.. What we wanted more than anything was food and by jove we got it. Made beasts of ourselves. Fruit, cherries, strawberries, ice cream, oh don't mention it. Just grand to get into civilization again. Of course everything is very expensive 20 francs a pay (14/8) does not go to far. But all the same I've got a few francs left. After a glorious day caught the train at 8 PM and reached camp about 10 o'clock. During the day I met several chaps  I knew one being Bert Wall who once lived in Maitland. He is the son of old Wall who was once an auctioneer. I bought a few postcards which sweetheart I'll send along in due course. Will try and get another day off next week. Well dear the time is drawing near when the long looked for cable will be due. You mentioned in your letter to expect the greatest event about the 24th, that is tomorrow week, every day after that sweetheart I will be waiting and expecting the great news every minute. Darling I will keep all I've got to say and how I feel until I get the news then kiddie. I will give full vent to my feelings.</p>
<p>Going to censorship it is very hard to write for nothing concerning military is allowed to be written. If it were allowed I could write scores of pages and very good news at that. The mail has just come in and as usual yours truly got a skinner one of the boys received 39 letters.</p>
<p>Will now ring off, kiddie and make way for a wash and swim. Au revoir to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband with tons and tons of kisses.</p>
<p>Don</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Your ever loving letter Number 39, reached me yesterday. It is the first letter of yours kiddie that I have received since arriving in France, hence greatly pleased. It was simply grand to get one off my dear&rsquo;s letters after such a long spell without any. In addition to your letter,  kiddie I received one from Aunty For, Vi, George, Fred Wade and two from Keith, so considered my luck was in. George was in hospital at Boulogne with diphtheria. His letter took three weeks to find me and at the time of his writing he was doing well and expected to be leaving with in a  week or so. I wrote him straight away. The letter from Fred was written in England just after I left. Keith was still in Blighty but expected a moved very shortly. He received the sweets etc you sent him on his birthday and by jove he was pleased, simply great so he says. He has bought a camera, send me a photo of himself taken by same, very good indeed. He asked my opinion regarding the transport, told him to keep in it as it was the best branch all the service. It is absolutely. News is very scarce, still posting but think the post is nearing its end. There is something in the air concerning peace in the near future, sincerely hope it is true so that I can get back to you sweetheart and little Mac. It is the opinion of all that this year will about see it out. Should have had today off but something went wrong with my pass, anyhow I expect to get another chance of  visiting the fine French town which is about 20 miles distance. Vi told me the experience you had at the circus, rather amusing. Wish I could have been with you and enjoyed ourselves like we did at the circus last year. Never mind will tell little Mac next year eh kiddie. That dream you had was very funny indeed, wish you were over here what sort of a good time we would have, what say you? Very pleased indeed to hear you are real well. I wonder how things are going with you at this present moment 3:40 PM. Suppose the great event is over or there is great excitement awaiting the event. Anxiously waiting for the cable now dearie. As you say the DAC is better than signaling but of course soldier has no say in the matter. I was in the DAC for about a fortnight before being transferred to the fifteenth battery. If you are in communication with aunty Fon tell her I will answer her long letter as soon as possible, have no idea when this will be because we are moving within a few hours. The weather of late has been extremely hot easily as hot as Australia, but we don't mind, it is better than the cold and we can keep cool by going for a swim. We have had to all three storms a day lately. The lightning and thunder is pretty severe. Most of the boys who I was with  at Lark Hill passed out of the school last month so I suppose they are on the way by this. Would be pleased to see Crowley and Hewitt again. The album of photos which I left in Blighty to be sent to you was delayed owing to some of the photos not coming to hand but it ought to be well on its way by this. We were going to hold sports tomorrow but they have been canceled indefinitely.</p>
<p>Well dearest I now say au revoir for the present tons and tons of kisses to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband.</p>

<p>My Darling wife</p>
<p>Here are fine postcards which I am sure will be of interest to you. Yesterday morning we broke camp and moved off to a French village about 10 km distance. We are billeted fairly comfortable. There is one good feature about this village we are able to purchase strawberries, cherries and oranges that is while the money lasts. The country is looking grand at present, flowers growing wild everywhere, the poppy being the most prominent. The hall countryside is covered with poppies. These cards are places where I have visited. Anxiously waiting for the cable kiddie. Au revoir for the present Love and kisses to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband.</p>

<p>Postcard</p>
<p>My darling wife</p>
<p>I wrote you a couple of days ago, nothing of importance has happened since then. Hope those five cards  are welcomed. The building in which we are billeted was a military hospital, our quarters being Number 4 ward. On or about today June 24 is I understand the time for the great event. Wonder what you darling are doing at the present moment 2:35 PM. Sincerely hope and trust that everything will be well. It might have happened a week ago or it may be another week before it takes place so dear every minute I am expecting the cable giving me the joyous news. I answered Aunty Fon&rsquo;s long letter the other day. Hope to be spending another day at the city during the week. It is grand to get away from the military for a few hours. Will write a letter in a day or so when I hope to have some news of little Mac.</p>
<p>Love and kisses to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband.</p>

<p>The mail has just arrived, letters and papers are strewn all over the floor all out billet but sorry to say none belong to yours truly. Have not had any letters for sometime now, very disappointed, I can assure you but of course kiddie I know it is no fault of yours, will have to be patient, they will come in due course. There is one thing I am very impatient about and that is the cable. Expecting it any moment sweetheart. Sincerely hope that everything went off okay. I feel certain that every care will be taken of my dear. Kiddie if you have any socks send them all along so as they will reach me before the winter sets in. Plenty of socks is of the greatest necessity. I have about six pairs which have not been used yet. The severe winter of France is very tough on socks. Have not heard lately from George. Wrote him about a week ago but no answer to date. He might easily get a trip to Blighty out of his sickness. No further particulars about Frank, have been making inquiries but no results. His unit is no where near us. Our battery has been acting as duty battery to a school in this village. The school ended today so we expect to be getting a move on. My duty the last three days has been patrolling. I along with 8 others secure a home each and proceed to different points along the road sanctioning the people not to proceed on account of the firing. Great fun is experienced in explaining matters to the French people as we are not experts in speaking French, any how we soon make them understand. If we return to our old camp I am going to get a day off to visit Amiens, where a chap can have a really good time. It is about 10 miles from here but that's too far  to walk so will wait and chance getting off from the next camp when I can catch a train. Have already been there once a very good day. No doubt you are all anxious to know when the war is going to end. As far as we are concerned we have no idea it seems as far off as ever, but one never can tell. The other day we were working out in the street when Gen. Birdwood passed this was his remark-: Keep working boys only two more months to go. Nobody takes any notice of what he says. Anyhow let us hope so. It was a little talk about peace about a week ago but that's the end of it. We do not look every day for peace it will come sooner or later so its no use worrying about it. But I wish it would hurry up that all I can get back to my darling wife and little Mac. What a time we will have then eh kiddie. The fields of France are at present looking beautiful, flowers of all descriptions, everywhere. The country side is a huge garden. Blah Sunday afternoon a cricket match took place between our battery and the school. It resulted in a win for our battery needless to say the boys were very pleased. Yesterday a football match was to have taken place but postponed at the last monument. Have not heard from Nellie Fry lately. Unike her but I suppose my letters are being held up somewhere. Strawberries and cherries are fairly plentiful about here but the prices are high. Of course we have our share of the fruit but needless to say we don't always pay for them. When I write that we are looked after by madams and mademoiselles it Is absolutely wrong. We sleep on the floor, make our own beds in fact do everything ourselves. All the same it is not a bad life. One thing I forgot to mention chats chats here there and everywhere. No need to explain what chats are we are all more or less chatty. No man is a soldier until he is chatty. But won&rsquo;t it be heaven to be back in my own home,  and a fine bed to sleep in with my loving wife and child. Wish to heaven that the time would hurry up.. Newspapers are delivered here every afternoon so we are not all together without news. I see they are going to have another shot at conscription. I wonder what the results will be this time. Will now ringing off dearest. Au revoir with love and kisses to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband. With thousands of kisses.</p>

<p>12 months today sweetheart is the day on which we did the deed of deeds. How time flies in one way it seems only a few months ago but when I think how long it is since I saw your dear face well it seems ages. There is one thing certain the last 8 months have been very long indeed but kiddie I don't think the time is very far off when I will see my dear  wife's face once again. This day 12 months ago was it not a great day, perhaps the greatest day of our lives unless the day of my return and beats it. It may or it may not but what a day that will be after such a long separation, meeting the dear girl whose first wedding anniversary is today and our dear baby. But the wedding day what joyous recollections come to mind. Saturday morning doing odds and ends getting ready, then at last motoring down to the church with Jerry. Then a few minutes wait, a very short few minutes, eh darling. First George puts in an appearance, of course he starts the fun with his humor, then comes the girl of my heart, how beautiful she looked, then the slight trouble putting the ring on, then married, married. Could there be two happier individuals then you and I darling, of course there could not. Next the confetti, the breakfast, the train journey.  Sydney was reached, fixed up at the hotel, then a quiet stroll and then the chemist, (here the fun begins). Eventually returning to the &ldquo;Sydney&rdquo; and spent our first night. What a good time we had, eh sweetheart. Yes dearest it was great, would very much like to have been going through the whole business again today. Sincerely hope and trust that we will be together next first of July and right royally celebrating the event. Intended to sending you a cable, but have not, much ready cash of course. I have money in &ldquo;Blighty&rdquo; but that's there for a rainy day. Hope you were not disappointed in not receiving a cable. Anyhow my thoughts are of you all this day and how I wish that I could have you in my arms giving you a big cuddle and showers of kisses. Sweetheart take these XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>Suppose you would like to know what I'm doing today well at 2 AM I went on a horse picquet* and remained there till 11 o'clock then I went out on patrol. While at my post an old woman came and spoke to me. She was a refugee for Anas. The afternoon was cold so she brought me a glass of hot coffee which I greatly appreciated. Returning from patrol at 6 PM have had tea and now about to go and see one of my boy friends. Will finish this letter tomorrow and state how 1st July finished. Having a green envelope I intend to make the most of it. Good night darling take these anniversary kisses . XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Love Don</p>
<p>Before letting you know how I finished up last night I will try and give you a little news. Last Friday I received 16 letters was not that great; 4 from you darling, 1 from mum, 1 auntie Alice,1 Auntie Edie,1 Stan Fry,1 Mrs. Mannel, 1 Miss Sutton, 2 Nellie Fry, 1 Mrs. Smith, 1 Harry Beardsmore and 2 from Phyllis. Was that not grand, for one mail, tell you kiddie I was worse than a youngster with a new toy. Will answer your loving letters altogether in this one. I understand there has been a lot of mail from here to Australia gone to the bottom, sincerely hope, kiddie you receive all mine, especially the album of 96 photos also the solvents of Salisbury. I also sent an album of photos containing 12 views to dad, mum, Auntie Em and Phyllis and your mother. They were posted on different dates so some of them surely will arrive okay. Phyll in her letters tells me that you and she have some good chat on the phone. Wish I could ring you up from here darling, what a long talk we would have to be sure. If I can't talk to you by phone, you know, dear that my thoughts are continually of you, and hoping and busting that we two are able to embrace one another very shortly and continue the joy of our married life.</p>
<p>The daylight savings business seems to be causing a great deal of trouble, why I cannot say, it is in vogue in England and France and every soldier to a man thinks it just the thing. In our opinion it is most suitable for Australia than for this country. But never mind it can be all day or all night so long as I get back to my darling wife and little one.</p>
<p>No cable yet I am on pins and needles. Have not had any letters from Keith lately but by the last later he was well.  By jove he did have a good time at Cape Town, did not want to leave and from what he told me there was a girl in the case, in fact girls. Jerry is getting gay** somewhat. Harry Beardsmore is down at the base in  Le Harve. He said he if ever I should be going through to be sure and call on him and if at any time there is anything he could do for me to let him know straight away. If I could only get to the base for a while then would be something doing to be sure. Saturday afternoon we received a few Christmas comforts, rather late don't you think, buy better late than never. They were gifts donated by Melbourne people. I got a tin of cocoa and a tin of paste. I may state the men see very very little of the comforts send from Australia and when they do it is only what other people don't want. They pass through too many hands before the right people get them, the right people are privates and gunners.&#8232;Last Friday I had the day off so left camp at 8AM for the city of Amiens. Had to walk about 4 miles to the main road, and then caught a motor bus. It was a glorious run into the city, the road running through an avenue of trees for 8 miles. It was a sight for sore eyes. On the way we passed hundreds of German prisoners working on the roads, also numerous motor lorries carrying French soldiers to the line. Had a good look around the city, the best part of the day was when I was feeding. I just had enough money to get myself a few good feeds.</p>
<p>Pay day again today so I am right again for a few weeks. When we are in camp there is very little  to buy so I don't require much money. It's when you take these trips to Amiens that the money goes. I got home that night about 9 o'clock and waiting for me was the batch of 16 letters so that was a glorious ending to a good day. </p>
<p>Had just going to bed on Thursday night when  I was told that I was wanted downstairs. Of course I got up and looked out of the window and who should it be but Stan Coldrake. He is camped in the same village as myself. Stan had been visiting the 2nd DAC that afternoon and heard to his surprise that I was in the 15th Battery. So he went to the 15th looking for me only to find we had shifted. He was very disappointed and then asked where we had gone and to his surprise was told the village in which he has been camped for about two months. Fancy the two of us being in the same village for over a week and not seeing one another. Anyhow he came straight to our billets and got me out of bed. What a good talk we did have to be sure. Saturday night we had a few hours together, Sunday midday we had a few minutes together, I intended having dinner and tea with Stan but duty presented me from doing so.</p>
<p>Darling I finished off the day of the 1st July by spending a few hours with Stan up in his hut. Will see him tonight if possible for we are leaving here tomorrow returning to our old camp, for how long I cannot say. Stan is a cook at present only a temporary job he's on a good wicket and hopes it will be permanent. He is cook to about 20 sergeants in a school. Nellie Fry told me about Bernie Curtis being seriously wounded and that he was doing well, Best of luck to him. She had a great job in finding anything out about him but eventually after a great deal of trouble she was rewarded. Nellie mentions having sent you a cable about Frank, also stating that I was in France and well so I am. In  a letter to her George said he expected to be going over to England in about three weeks time for 10 days, if that is so which I sincerely trust is right, he should be over there now, having a good time, lucky beggar. Nellie tells me Sid Fry is having a good time with the nurse that nursed him during his illness. In fact he's making the pace. Also  she tells me George has received your letters dated 15th and 23rd April while in hospital. The letters I received from you kiddie were numbers 22, 31, 36, 37. Number 22 was dated January 24th so therefore it took a long time in finding me. Of course the address was the cause of the delay so in the future address my letters care of Nellie Fry or to the 15th Battery A.F.A.;  A.I.F. France. In addressing them to Nellie leave a space at the bottom of the envelope for the re-address.</p>
<p>You want to know what the meals are like well all I can say is that three together would not make a decent 11 o&rsquo;clock. We are as good as the &lsquo;Dagoes&rsquo; able to live on the smell of an oily rag. So you are still busy with the little pretty things, what what I give to see you working at them. Auntie Alice in her letter told me you had a glorious collection and how I ought to see them, so I will shortly I hope, eh kiddie. Can easily imagine what your trip through the Newcastle shops would be like, suppose you had a look at baby clothes in every shop why should you not being the wife of Donald C McDonald. Yes Kiddie I'm looking forward to our stay at the &lsquo;Sydney&rsquo; of course we will have to have a bed not a cot for a cot may be too small for the twins, don't go crook now dear.</p>
<p>Got rather a shock regarding the money business but in one way I'm not surprised they are taking into account the deferred pay but that does not matter. They agreed to give me 
&pound;2, less any deductions. Of course the deferred pay should be deducted as long as they don't cut it down anymore. Of course it must be taken and nothing said for I am extremely lucky to get any money at all. Everything is okay in that way. How is the military treating you, suppose everything is alright in that direction.</p>
<p>Wish the fig and ginger jam also the cake would hurry up and come, by jove sweetheart, it will be more than special as it was made by you kiddie. The trouble is when you get these nice things they go too quickly. I'll bet the fig and ginger won't last long. I'm very pleased indeed kiddie that you sent the photos of the Mata, certainly they are not very good but when I look at them they send my mind wandering back to that time I took her photos in the garden. What an old fidget she is when the camera puts in an appearance. As soon as I get back she will have to put up with having her Photo taken a good number of times so she had better start and get ready.</p>
<p>3rd July making another start kiddie. In your letter number 36 you mentioned about my receiving your photos, of course you have heard, long before now, that you got them okay. So you have had Rose over again, coming in quite unexpectedly. Very sorry to hear that collie dog of Muriels has died, it was such a fine dog too. Miss Sutton in her letter gave me all the office new, also mentioned that she had received the photo. I forgot all about that photo.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was out patrolling again returning about 6 o'clock. Soon as I got back I got a great surprise as two of your loving letters and one from Mrs. Smith were waiting. After I had read them I went up to spend the night with Stan, also to have tea with him. He is a bosker cook, there for my &lsquo;little many&rsquo; got well filled. This is what I had; roast beef, roast potatoes, onions and sauce, rice and custard and 2 cups of tea. Tell you kiddie it was just great. After tea he and I went over to a farm and helped a French woman do her milking and when  we finished we carried it home for her. Needless to say I made the milk smile. This Frenchwoman is the happy mother of a baby boy about a month old, I lovely kid, name is George. Her husband is up in the line at present and she is running their farm expecting the war to end in three months time. I returned fairly early to our billets as we moved off again today. We left at 9 o'clock for our old camp arriving at 3 o'clock. I did the journey by bike but was very unlucky I had four punctures. Have no idea how long we are staying here but do not think it will be long before we are on the move again. The two letters I received last night what numbers 38 and 42. By jove kiddie, you have no idea how pleased I was, absolutely overjoyed to hear you have received a large batch of my letters, well that was simply great, glorious news.</p>
<p>So you think it is time I started to be good, why sweetheart I have always been good. We don't get many opportunities here to go to church. I'm getting to be a heavy pipe smoker kiddie, it is good company in these parts. Yes darling if there any decent jobs about I will try and get hold of one for your sake, sweetheart and little Macs. I am at present on the battery staff of the 15th battery. Can easily imagine you, kiddie, the Matar and the boss comparing letters must have had a good time. Yes kiddie always number but your letters it lets me know exactly how they are coming along. Sorry I did not keep up the numbering of mine. You seem very pleased about the change to the old time. I will tell you this time next year what I think of it, that will be the time, eh love. Yes dear I know well how you move about in bed at night. I&rsquo;d give thousands to be in bed with you tonight darling but the time will come again, then what oh, eh what, don't mention it. Very sorry to hear that your father has not been too well also that Donnie has had trouble with his teeth. Have to laugh about Mrs. Hill and the ring, hope she does not succeed. The photos of we two and  Charlie are simply great, I was extremely pleased to get them. Good news came through today it is to the effect that the Russians have started by capturing 8000  prisoners on the first day, sincerely hope they keep it up, for it is sure to make a big difference as to when peace will be declared.</p>
<p>The United States Army is over here now, that  have been here over a fortnight. It's not a small force by any means either. The Germans will now start to scratch their hands.</p>
<p>Darling is it a boy or a girl old boys and girls? I am anxiously waiting for the cable, it should be on its way by this. Sincerely hope and trust that everything went off okay and that my dear wife did not have to put up with any unnecessary pain and that you darling and our baby are both doing well. Have been trying to think how I will feel when the joyous news comes along, suppose I will go nearly mad with delight. Can assure you dearest that I am greatly excited at present waiting for the news. What's the baby to be called? Suppose names will be well pulled about before a final selection is made. Wish I could be with you all to have a say but i am sure that the selection which you make kiddie, will suit me, and so we two are the chief people to be pleased, everything in my opinion will be just it.</p>
<p>Well darling it is getting dark, we have no lights so will have to close. Anxiously waiting for the news. I'm grand kiddie, Best of health. Love and kisses to my darling wife from your ever own and a loving husband with tons and tons of kisses and embraces galore.</p>

<p>Another surprise, I was wounded last Tuesday afternoon (14th August). Two slight wounds in the back, nothing serious. Going under the x-ray to locate one piece of shell. Fritz has been giving us I terrible time, was partially buried twice and gassed once on the one day so consider myself extremely lucky in getting out of it so lightly. My one hope now is Blighty would that not be grand. Will write to you again soon. Going to cable Neita tomorrow. The military are sure to notify her but their message will be vague.

<p>I wrote you Sunday also yesterday so kiddie please excuse this short note. In one of my letters I mentioned having asked the agent general to cable to you for money, well today I received word from them stating that they had ceased cabling to Australia for money for soldiers so kiddie please send me along some money, which ever way you think best, so that it will be in the bank when ever I require it. Have about 2 pounds in my pocket at present, but if good luck should come my way and I get more leave, well until that arrives I will have to borrow off some of my rich relations. </p>
<p>Should I be here for the weekend intend spending from noon Saturday until Sunday midnight at Salisbury. That takes money. But of course one must have a good time when possible, now that I am in dear old Blighty. </p>
<p>Today received two letters one from Dorothy and one from Annie Roberts. Dot&rsquo;s letter was very nice indeed, said they were sorry I could not have spent more time with them, she said I had made quite a hit with the family, what do you think of that sport, some class your hubby, darling. She also sent me at tin of tobacco. Owing to the numerous air raids they left Herre Hill today for a more quiet shop. Working 30 miles from London. All London people if possible are leaving for districts not in the raid area. Bournemouth is simply crowded with such folk, impossible to get houses or even apartments there. Dot could not give me their new address but intends sending it as soon as they get settled.</p>
<p>Annie wrote in reply to my letter. Asked me to come again as soon as possible also wants one of my photos. She wished to be remembered to all you people. Kiddie I am always looking at those photos of you and our little darling. They are &lsquo;bosca&rsquo;. Neville is in three studies, laughing. asleep and wide awake with a stern look. Could not have had them taken better, simply lovely, wish I could take him in my arms and give him a good squeeze and kiss. The day is coming when I will be able to do it, eh dearest. Sooner the better.</p>
<p>Going to a concert tonight with a few of the boys, at the YMCA expect it to be good. Last night went to a lecture on the greatest of the British Empire. Please excuse short note, you understand don&rsquo;t you darling.</p>
<p>Love kisses and embraces to my two darlings from your most loving husband and father with thousands of kisses and oceans of love.</p>
<p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hubby and Daddy</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>By the above address you will see that I am still at Hencott. When I arrived here I expected to remain only 2 or 3 days, but having to have my teeth stopped, caused me to stop. Have been here a fortnight now and things are not too bad, was to have my teeth attended to this afternoon, but dentist too busy, no doubt it will be Wednesday before I go again, it's only a half days job. Then will go in the first draft to the artillery details camp which is about 7 miles from here. After that, well, France. </p>
<p>Our artillery camp at Lark Hill is being moved tomorrow to another part of the plains. The cold weather has started, this morning we had a beautiful frost, talk about being cold, don't mention it, have to prepare for the winter now, sooner spend it here than over in France. Last Wednesday night I went to a concert given by a Bristol party. Thursday night another given by a Welsh party and Friday night still another by a London party. They were all very good indeed. Tonight&rsquo;s concert is going to be given by the band. So you see, kiddie we are not too bad off for concerts, what do you say? </p>
<p>Rev. Mc Cook is in this camp now, took up duties last week. On Saturday two boys from the hut and myself went into Salisbury and spent the weekend. Left camp shortly after dinner per motor and arrived at Salisbury about 2 o'clock. Had a look round the town during the afternoon, tea at the YMCA, ham and eggs etc.(&ldquo;goodo&rdquo;) night at the theater and witnessed the highly sensational drama entitled &ldquo;The Mill Girls Wedding.&rdquo; Of course it was the usual type of play, a poor, pretty girl, meets a man, who leads her astray, she takes the wrong turning, a baby is born, anyhow her lover forgives her and at last they marry and live happily ever after. Was not too bad of a show. </p>
<p>Sunday morning attended service at the Cathedral, afternoon down the river and after tea about 9 o'clock caught the motor, home to camp, after an enjoyable weekend. While there met several of the boys I came over with, very surprised to see me, they themselves have not been over to France yet. All my old mates have gone over, Bill Crowley went about three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Kiddie in my previous letters I have asked you to send some money along, if you have not done so yet, rush it along my dear for I am nearly broke and if my luck is in, I will try and take a run up to Scotland at the end of the month. If I can get the time off, will get a few quid, about 10 pounds off Nellie and spend three or four days up in Bonney Scotland. Have not heard from Nellie for over a week, not like her for she is always writing. In fact I have not had a letter of any sort for about a week. Nellie no doubt thinks I've shifted. All my letters, I get through her now. I think I told you I received a letter from Fred Wade. It was written over a month ago and in it he expected to be going over to France in about a weeks time.</p>
<p>Darling how are you getting on with out bonny son, wish to heaven the d&hellip; old war was over so that I could get back to you two darlings. The war you say, no doubt will never end, and that's what it looks like over here too. The fine offensives must have pleased you all, of late. Very pleased and lucky to be faraway. The Australian's did wonderful work, in fact surpassed any other army in the operations, but at what cost: your people won't hear about the losses, just as well. What the Tommy's could not do was done by the Australians. The heaviest fighting was at Ypres, right in the sector, in which I left. There is no greater battleground in all Europe.</p>
<p>Well darling Neville, how is your mum treating you? Now if you don't get your own way, kick up a terrible row and then wait until I get home and see what I&rsquo;ll do. Mum will get a terrific smack, where, oh well right on the lips. Won&rsquo;t our first kiss be a beauty, kiddie.</p>
<p>I am sure Neville will be a good boy, cannot be otherwise, that is if he takes after his dad.
Well must ring off darlings, be a good boy Neville until I come home and then mum and dad and you will have a grand time. Why, my darling wife, cannot you too be over here, England is a grand country in the summertime and what a great time we two could give our bonny son. Never mind we will have it in dear old Australia very soon I hope. </p>
<p>Love and endless kisses to my darling wife and bonny son from your loving hubby and daddy, with oceans of kisses and embraces.</p>
<p>Loving husband and dad  </p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>To Neita, Neville with love</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Well my dear I told you that I received a large mail of 18 letters, all old ones. It was very funny reading them regarding the uncertainty of events prior to June 23rd. But everything has turned out okay has it not kiddie. Keith&rsquo;s letter which was dated 20th of August has very little news. At the time of writing he was working very hard 7;30 to 12; 30, and 2.00 to 5:50 and 6:30 to 9:00. Sunday afternoon off when possible. One does not mind working in France especially near the line. Keith mentioned having met Harley Eckford, Jack Sawyer, Tommy Hanson, Les Barbour, and Billy Skinner. You can well imagine them having a good talk about old Maitland. Ethel Beardsmore knew all the home news by her letter. Auntie Von had written her giving all the news. She told me that her husband Harry, who is Commandant 5th Australian Divisional Base wishes me to call on him. Will certainly do so when passing through Harve. </p>
<p>Vi told me that what hair our darling had, was like his ma&rsquo;s, lucky kid. just as well he has not got hair like mine. There's been nothing doing in camp for the last few days, last night I went to a YMCA concert which was really first-class. Going to have a rest tonight, remain in the hut, and  write letters. If I'm still in camp will spend the weekend in Salisbury. Have only a few bob, I think I will be able to manage it. Your postcard dated 26th of June is not too bad,&rdquo;I ain&rsquo;t no girl&rdquo; I will bet our boy will not wished to be taken for a girl. </p>
<p>By all your letters dearest my mail you have been receiving very well for which I'm very pleased and thankful. Wish the album of photos would turn up. Yes darling I thought the arrival of our dear would  help your mother and father, in fact all of you, to keep your mind off your trouble. You say don't worry about presents, well kiddie I&lsquo;d like very much to send you darling and Neville something but I'm practically broke, made it too much of a welter while on leave. Anxiously waiting for you to send me along some cash, then I'll start and make things fly again. </p>
<p>I sent a card to Rene the other day, addressed to the Myrtle Hotel, do not know whether she is still there, if she has moved no doubt it will be forwarded to her. Yes, kiddie you were indeed very smart making the son but I'm sure now that you have our dear baby to look after, sex are a thing out of the question. Charlie's statement about taking a note to school with the excuse &ldquo;had to stay at home and mind the baby&rdquo; is very good, just like Charlie.</p>
<p>The photo of yourself, mother and auntie is just &rsquo;it&rsquo;. But why kiddie did you not stand in the front and show off your beauty.  I would not have minded, could have given my eyes a feast off it. What can I hear you saying dear never mind, keep the rousing until I return to my two dear ones. Nurse will have her time cut out now looking after three. How would you like to have had three, first shot Kiddie, what a family. Got rather  a surprise when I heard that Vera and Bill were married, you gave her the right advice, as for the good time, well I guess, wish we were having the same good time now darling. Never mind when I return we will make up for the time I've been away, bet your sweet life.  Not too much of your scrambled eggs and toast, makes my mouth water dear. You said in one of your letters that you were including Nurse Braye&rsquo;s address, well darling I cannot find it, you must be in love no doubt about that, eh darling. As you desire sweetheart will enclose a couple of my signatures. It is simply grand to read your letter, the first one written after our darling came on the scene. It was the first letter giving me the exact time of His Majesty's arrival. Can well imagine the excitement at Charles Street. Would have given everything I possess to have been with you darling, but I'll make up for it when the second, third, fourth, &hellip;&hellip;.. twelfth arrives.</p>

<p>Received a letter from Stan Coaldrake this afternoon. He is well. After spending four weeks at the battery he returned to the school, drawing rations for the staff. It's a good job and Stan is certain to hang on to it. Suppose my little darling is making rapid progress now, what a good time you must be having, kiddie. Always trying to imagine what my two loved ones are doing. Remember me to all friends. Love to Regent and Charles Street folk.

<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished one letter and posted it. So please kiddie don't be disappointed with a one pager. I&rsquo;m broke, only good for 1/6p. I wrote to Nellie today, asking her to send me along 30 /-until the weather breaks. It's this way, I require several articles of winter clothing, gloves, socks etc. also at Christmas time I would like to give Nellie and Dorothy some small present. I have sent asking you to send along a tenner, kiddie it won't do any harm if you send along another fiver. Won&rsquo;t go to waste. The money you will send along may not be here till after Christmas, but I sincerely hope and trust it comes long before then. I'll try my utmost to spend Christmas in England if successful, money, money, money will be needed. Will spend Christmas with Nellie if I'm in England. The chances are against my staying that long in Blighty.</p>
<p>Love kisses and embraces in galore to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever own and loving husband and father.</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>It is bitterly cold, come and cuddle me, come and cuddle me, what would I give for we 3 to have a good cuddle up, would be simply great. Wait till I get home to my love ones. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX loving husband and father.</p>

<p>On Friday I received another old mail, seven letters in all, two from you darling, Numbers 66 and 67, 2 from mum, 1 Charlie Edwards, 1 Elsie, and a booklet, &rdquo;Private Papers for those on Active Service&rsquo; from Arnold Connelly. Was very surprised to hear that Grace and Bert Walters are doing the deal .</p>
<p>Charlie Edwards  letter was full of news, he is the only member of the &ldquo;Pie Club left, every one having enlisted. Mum&rsquo;s second letter was written on June 24th the day after the arrival of our darling. There was no doubt about her being excited, her letter plainly showed that, why should she not to be excited, as from what I hear, Neville is absolutely the most wonderful baby born.</p>
<p>2 PM Saturday, three of us left camp and caught a motor for Salisbury arriving at about 2;30 o'clock. Had a lot of shopping to do for all the other boys in the hut, which took up all the afternoon. While in London my watch went wrong, cost me 8/6 to have it cleaned etc. Then after getting into camp it went wrong again, so I had to leave it at a jewelers on Saturday another 4/-. The watch is suffering from shell shock I think. Had afternoon tea at the Council Chambers. This place is used as a tea room and rest for soldiers. After tea we went to the theatre and witnessed a very good show. I had a weekend pass, the other two boys only a Saturday pass, so they returned to camp. I slept at the YMCA, a fine room and bonser bed for 1/6. Had a glorious nights sleep, simply beautiful to get between white sheets. Very late when I got up on Sunday morning and it was close on eleven o'clock before I finished breakfast. After having a good feed went for a walk round the river, read the Sunday papers and had a good smoke. After dinner started for a walk round, when I met one of the boys who came over from Australia at the same time as myself. Of course we had a good talk over old times. It was only five minutes after leaving him when I met another old pal, one of my best friends on the boat and while in camp. His name is Genett and he is on very friendly terms with Rita Pilgrim. When we met, talk about being excited, had we been girls, it's certain we would have embraced one another. Went for a walk, had afternoon tea at the council chambers. He has a staff job in Salisbury so boards with private people. He took me round to his &lsquo;dugout&rsquo;, met the people, tea together and afterwards a good old talk over the fire. These people want me to make their home, my home when in Salisbury, don't think I'll avail myself, for I expect to be leaving here this week. They are very nice people indeed. Of course it's very nice to have a private home to go to when you get tired of strolling around. Caught motor at 8:30 and turned into camp bed about 10 o'clock. While in Salisbury I bought a frame for my photo, but they have not yet arrived, have written giving them a hurry up. Also bought a number of Christmas cards which I sent along this morning.</p>
<p>Darling I willing enclose one of the cards, I think them capital. Soon as I returned last night a letter was handed to me, who do you think it was from, well Mrs Crowley. She is working in a Ladies Canteen at the Australian headquarters. Wants to know if she can be of any assistance to me regarding clothes money etc. Told me also that Eric Hewitt has just come out of hospital and going into camp again. Have no idea what's been wrong with him. Very good of her writing me. Wants me to call and see her if I'm in London.</p>
<p>I'm nearly frozen, can hardly write so please excuse, must finish so as to catch the mail. Received a letter from Don today. Will now close darling, I will write soon as I get warm again.
Love and kisses by the millions to my dear wife and darling son from your ever own loving husband and father with oceans and oceans of kisses and love.</p>

<p>Have just returned from the dentist. He just started a job of stopping two teeth, tomorrow morning I have to go again when I will be finished. There's a draft leaving here on Friday which I'm certain to be on. We first go to Sutton Veny*, a sorting up camp, will only be there a few days and then move on to our artillery camp. The staying in the artillery camp is very uncertain, may be a week or maybe a month, just ones luck. Do not like the idea of leaving here, rise at 7 o&rsquo;clock, breakfast 7:45, fall in at 9 AM. 3/4 of an hours route march, after that 1/2 hour jerks, then about an hour's football. Dinner at 12:45. Fall in at 2 PM, route march  till 3 PM football until 4 o&rsquo;clock. Tea at 4:45. Concert or vaudeville and pictures at night. Weekends off from Saturday midday till Sunday midnight, able to go anywhere you like on condition there's no traveling on trains. So you say darling things are not too bad here. </p>
<p>Yesterday I received a letter from Flo Roberts. The day before one from Mrs Crowley. Think I told you about her letter. She is working at the Ladies Canteen at headquarters Horseferry Road from 9 AM to 6 PM Monday to Friday. Her hubby has just recently gone over to France. She offered me assistance regarding money and clothing wants me to call on her the next time I'm in London. Told me Eric Hewitt had been wounded but had gone into camp at Sutton Veny so no doubt I will see him at the end of the week. Sweetheart I have to consider myself very lucky to have been away from France during the last few months. The Australian casualties for August September and October are within the vicinity of 70,000 and we heard today that the 4th and 5th Division are being disbanded to reinforce the 2nd and 3rd. There should never have been a 4th and 5th division for the reinforcements from Australia were never sufficient.</p>
<p>Suppose that you received my letter asking you to send a tenner, also another asking for a further fiver. Wrote to  Nellie the other day for the loan of a few shillings. </p>
<p>No more new sweetheart. How is our darling boy getting on, take good care of him dearest, until I get home, which may not be so very long now. What what I give to be able to nurse him on one knee and you dear on the other. Wait till I return. What a time we will have, to be sure.
Au revoir for the present darling. My photos have not yet come to hand, written about them but no reply.</p>
<p>Love and kisses to my sweetheart wife, and darling son from your ever own and loving husband and dad with oceans and oceans of love and kisses to my two darlings.</p>
<p>Hubby and daddy</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>PS. Hurry up with some photos of Neville sweetheart, those you sent me are simply bosker but I want some of our darling a little older. Love and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>*Hendcott probably Hurdcott</p>
<p>Hurdcott The camp located at&nbsp;Compton Chamberlayne&nbsp;and close to Fovant (and the Fovant badges, pictured right) became known as Hurdcott Camp as it was on land that was part of two farms, one of which bore that name. Australian battalions moved to Hurdcott in 1916, and in March 1917 Hurdcott House became the headquarters of&nbsp;No.3 Command Depot&nbsp;for the AIF. At the camp practice trenches were dug, together with a bayonet fighting assault course close to a bombing ground, and five huts were transformed into a camp hospital. In November 1917&nbsp;No.4 Command Depot&nbsp;moved from Codford to Hurdcott. By January 1919 the command depots had all but ceased to function in their primary use and were now receiving men from France on their way back home.</p>
<p>**Sutton Veny - 1st World War</p>
<p>The proximity of Sutton Veny to Warminster and Salisbury Plain ensured that Sutton Veny and the surrounding villages in the upper Wylye Valley area, was an ideal location to barrack troops in order for them to train prior to deploying to northern France. Supplies arrived via the Salisbury to Warminster railway line, and in November 1914 a railway&nbsp;spur from Heytesbury was laid the few miles to Sutton Veny to convey camp building materials and water for the troops. Approximately 10 Camps were built around Sutton Veny.</p>

<p>This is Sunday afternoon, wonder what my two darlings are doing, wish I were back in dear old Maitland with you all, will be some day, the sooner the better eh sweetheart. On Friday I received a registered packet from Nellie containing my photos and 2 pounds, also a letter from Nellie and one from Aunt Rosa. </p>
<p>Well the photos, they are not too bad, Nellie says they are good, but not nearly good enough. Kiddie today I posted one to our darling son, one to your dear self and one to mum and Phyllis. There are two positions, cap on and cap off. Everybody says the one with  the cap on is the better of the two, of course it's a matter of opinion. Yours is the one with the cap on, and Neville&rsquo;s which is in a frame, without, so darling you have both positions. You may think I'm thin by the photos but it's only in the face. To satisfy my darling will give you a little flap about myself. When I met some of the November quota boys last week, they all passed the remark, how well I looked, slightly thinner in the face, but the body the same, an ideal soldier. Was told by the jerk instructor the other day (been doing jacks and football for five weeks now) that I'm a perfectly built man, liar I said. He said being 5 foot 10, and weight 12.3 stone, solid, no surplus flesh, hard as nails, square shoulders makes a well built man. Anyhow kiddie there's no doubt about it, the jerks and good food have made a wonderful difference in me. The boys who came into camp with me often remark of my great improvement. The reason why I tell you this darling is to let you know exactly how I am, never felt better in my life. You use to rouse about my round shoulders, well kiddie, they are a thing of the past, if when I return, I am as I am now, you'll say come down a little you look too tall. </p>
<p>I suppose you would like to know who is  Aunt Rosa, well my adopted aunt, Mrs Morris. She was down at Nellie&rsquo;s when my photos arrived so of course helped herself. She was of the same opinion as Elsie, her daughter, they preferred the one with the cap, as Elsie says &ldquo;There is more devil in that one&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Of course I told you that I had written to Nellie for some cash, well she sent along &pound;2, I&rsquo;m right again for a few days. She said it was from &ldquo;The Bank of Love Ltd.&rdquo; Finishes her letter such, your Guarding Angel, in England, Nellie. By jove she is a character kiddie, I sincerely hope you all meet her in the near future. Do not mention this to anybody.</p>
<p>She told me Bernie had been under another operation, a frightful operation, and not successful by any means, but he is getting better slowly. Yesterday I received a letter from mum, card from Jeanne Gordon and four papers from Phyll. Fully intended going to Salisbury yesterday, just about to leave camp when an order came through cancelling all leave, on account of a general mobilisation of the British and Australian armies. Needless to say I was wild, have nothing to do but sit about camp. Was very anxious to go into the city as I wanted to buy some Christmas cards, also get my watch, which I left at LJ Shy jewelers for repairs. When I am to get it now, goodness only knows, for it is not safe for it to be posted and I am sure to be leaving here during the week. Friday most probably. Just as well I got some money from Nellie for on Thursday all I had was I halfpenny, broke, it's terrible to be broke in the army, you cannot borrow for all the boys are more or less in the same position. </p>
<p>This morning I went to church, good, what say you darling, going to be good again tonight, off to the pictures. Last night went to a concert given by the &ldquo;Dinkhums&rdquo; three ladies and two gents very good show. </p>
<p>Hope you are taking good care of our dear Neville, I hope to be home before this time next year, then I'll take a hand, bet you like eh sweetheart. Would give anything to be nursing him now, don't think I&rsquo;d get tired, do you think so kiddie. Well must ring off with love, kisses and embraces to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever own and loving husband and father with oceans and oceans of love and millions of kisses.

<p>This will be only a short letter, kiddie, have a lot to do as I am leaving this camp tomorrow before day break. Was warned this afternoon, this means leaving here about 5 AM for the camp at Sutton Veny. Will remain there are a few days only, then move to our artillery camp at Heytesbury.*  My stay there is very uncertain, anyhow France is the next move. Kiddie I wrote you last Monday stating that I received your birthday greetings cable on the 4th could not have been timed better. Was overjoyed to receive it and to know that my darling was well. Have more good news for you darling, on Wednesday I received two birthday parcels one from you sweetheart and one from your mother. They  arrived well to time, don't you think so dear. You wanted to know exactly in what condition they arrived. Well your mothers was okay, had it for tea on Wednesday night, shared it among the boys. The socks which our darling Neville helped to push in were very welcome, in need of socks. As for the other cake it was bosker, had it for tea tonight, a little left which we are going to have for supper. Can assure you sweetheart both cakes arrived in excellent condition, simply lovely to have a feed of good cake especially when they come from my darling.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon had one tooth stopped and one pulled, therefore making me fit to move to the next camp. At night attended a grand concert. On Thursday had a letter from Mrs Crowley, congratulating me on the arrival of our dear bonny boy. Went to another concert at night. Today received letter from mum, Phyll and Nellie. The Australian letters were the first I've received telling me that you received the particulars as to my wounds, but there are some letters missing I'm certain. Phyll enclosed cuttings regarding the marriage of Miss Harris, some class, just like them as long as there's plenty of show they are satisfied.</p>
<p>Darling will say au revoir for the present, will write soon as I get settled in the next camp.
Love kisses and embraces to my two darlings with millions and millions of kisses and oceans of kisses from your ever own loving husband and father.</p>

Knook Camp, Heytesbury was an Artillery training base on the edge of Salisbury plain, with Heytesbury House used as the officers&rsquo; quarters. From 1916 Australians occupied the camp. Heytesbury House was the home of Siegfried Sassoon, the first world war poet, from the 1930s until his death in 1967, aged 80.</p>

<p>My own darling wife and bonny son</p>
<p>News is very scarce, kiddie, I'll try and write a few lines. This is a very poor camp, there's nothing right with it. Food is awful, have complained in other camps but this is absolutely the worst. If it does not improve there is sure to be serious trouble. The drill is severe and on an empty stomach the boys are beginning to kick up. Mailing arrangements are rotten, there are thousands of letters at the post office for the boys, but we can't get them. There is absolutely no system, just like all of our Australian organisations. </p>
<p>Today I received my watch from the jeweler, hope it is alright this time. Last night four of us went to the camp pictures, they were first rate, about the best program I&rsquo;ve seen in England. Have seen a good deal of Eric Hewitt lately, but he is leaving tomorrow for Heytesbury Camp which is about 4 miles from here. There's another batch leaving here next Tuesday so no doubt I will be off with that lot. Will not be sorry either, anywhere would be better then here.</p>
<p>I see by the papers that there is going to be another attempt to pass conscription in Australia. Personally I don't give it a hope. As for the boys both here and in France 75% are positively against conscription. Billy Hughes and his followers can say what they like, the boys are fed up and will vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;. There is a great feeling of unrest right throughout the Australian army caused by the authorities themselves.</p>
<p>There has been a gang of men hanging round these camps and  Hurdcott sandbagging. A corporal, the night before going on leave to get married was knocked and relieved of &pound;40, he died within half an hour. Another man was hit and  &pound;14 taken, he recovered. A nurse was hit, not seriously and the paperboy poor kid about 12 was bagged  and relieved of his few coppers. He lingered for 5 days and passed away. It's not certain who is doing this work, but some of the Australian boys must be doing it. It's absolutely unsafe to go out on the roads at night by oneself. There's fully a dozen or more cases where our men and officers have been knocked lately. </p>
<p>Warminster, a fairly large town is about 4 miles from here, intend going In on Saturday all going well.</p>
<p>How is darling Neville getting on sweetheart. Wish I could get away from here over to my two darlings. What a good time we would have, eh sweetheart, never mind dear,  the time is surely coming when we three will be together having the time of our lives. Au revoir for the present Love and kisses to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever own and loving husband and father with kisses galore.</p>

<p>19th November 1917</p>
<p>My darling wife and bonny son</p>
<p>Well, kiddie, I am up to my neck in writing, have no less than 25 letters to answer. Somebody will have to get a short letter. Last Thursday I received 17 letters, 6 from you darling, 1 Keith, 1 Madge, 1 Grandma Fry, 1 Vi, 1 Auntie Jane, 1 Flo Roberts, 1 Auntie Edie, 1 Stanley, 1 Mary Goodsir, 1 Jeanne Goodsir, 1 Nellie Fry.. Today I have received 5 more from you sweetheart,1 Mum, 1 Mrs Crowley, 1 Grandpa Fry. So you see dearest, I&rsquo;ve got a job in front of me, don't really know where to start but I can tell you it is simply grand receiving them all. The numbers of yours kiddie, are 85, 86, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 97. The letters numbered 86 registered and 95 contained the photos of yourself and of our darling and most wonderful baby. They are simply glorious, but sweetheart I'll write another letter telling you exactly what I think of them, wish I could put them in a frame and hang them up in the hut.</p>
<p>Before I start to answer your letters dear, will tell you a little of the happenings during the last few days.  I was just going to the pictures on Thursday night when I received my mail, which included one from Nellie. Of course had a look at the pictures, very good and then returned to our hut and read most of the letters. Nellie&rsquo;s I left till next morning, lights were turned off before I finished, and in reading it next morning got a great shock, she gave me George's address, he is practically in the same camp as myself, only he's is in the infantry and I'm in the artillery section. He is working in the second battalion office. Soon as I got off parade I made for him, marched into the office and there was his lordship large as life, walking round the office. Soon as he caught sight of me he said down, stood up, sat down again, could hardly believe his eyes, then he yelled out Don. We then had a good talk over things, he being busy, I left and we met again for a couple of hours at night, had supper together. You can well imagine how we talked, just grand, showed one another all our photos, our darling boy caused a great deal of fun. George is in best of health, looking okay and is having the time of his life. Tomorrow he is off for two days leave to London. By the way he is having a great time with the girls, one especially, showed me her photo, she is just fine, something doing. As for his job, he's set at present there is no hope of him going to France, looks as if the job will last for the duration, lucky boy. </p>
<p>Eric Hewitt left here last Friday for Heytesbury and I understand he's leaving for France tomorrow. Saturday afternoon I went into Warminster and had a good look around. While there met Jim Ken. He is working at Warminster and has a job that will keep him away from France, keeping in good health and looking well. Returned to camp about 7 o'clock. Received a parcel from Phyll and Auntie Fon, containing tobacco, socks, jam etc, just the thing.</p>
<p>Sunday morning went to church, walked  to Heytesbury and had tea at a mate&rsquo;s place, Red Lion Hotel just fine. Food conditions in this camp are awful, starving, heavy work on empty stomachs, no d&hellip;. good. </p>
<p>Due to leave here on Friday, will only reign in the artillery camp a week at the longest, back again to France. Keith&rsquo;s letter was written fourth of November. He mentions having received a letter from Nelson Agnew who said that mum was wondering what had become of him. </p>
<p>Keith says it is a bad idea to write too regularly, at the same time he complains about not receiving any letters for an age. He is in the best of health and their column is moving to a quieter front. Can fully understand how hard it is for Jerry to write. In letter 55 received mum&rsquo;s slip expressing best wishes for the 4th.</p>
<p>So our darling boy has a dimple, and that's a sign of being a flirt, good luck to his lordship. But as for saying I was a flirt, well I never heard the like, you know well, kiddie, that I was not, never thought of ever doing such a thing and as for making eyes at French girls, that beats the band. I'm an old married man now and have only eyes for a girl and one boy and that's you dear and bonny Neville. Suppose I could make eyes if I tried but I will leave all that to the boys and I can assure you they make good use of their time.</p>
<p>Letter 86 came with the photos. Both yours sweetheart and babies photo grand, he is a darling without doubt, would give anything to be nursing him now. Will have more to say about the photos later. Nellie has not yet said anything about receiving the &pound;2, don't suppose Sid has given it to her yet, will ask her when I write.  Told you in my previous letters that the birthday cakes arrived okay, thanks muchly sweetheart. Letter 88 was written the day you receive word about my being wounded. Well darling I've told you all, you know long before now that I&rsquo;m A1 and wounds were not serious, although I was expecting a bad time. Had  terrible pains in the leg but after the operation everything was okay and soon healed. Would have been simply grand had you been with me kiddie, while I was in hospital, but of course that could not be, worst luck. Could not have been looked after better, there was no need for you to worry on that score dear. Although with all the kindness from the nurses there's nobody I would sooner have had at my bedside then my darling wife. Never mind, kiddie, I'm okay again, the sooner I get back to you two darlings the better, eh dear. So baby is to sit in the family chair, that's fine. Yes, kiddie the sooner we get into our home the better, soon as this war is over, then things will be alright, what a time we three will have dear don't mention it. Very pleased indeed to hear Aunt Em was better and going home. What about &rdquo;Coming Home&rdquo; kiddie. Hear that occasionally over this way, brings back old times, good and glorious old times. The three postcards are very good indeed see plenty of that business over here, France is the place to see the French soldiers kissing their loved ones. Good sport watching them. </p>
<p>Fancy you thinking I would not tell you how bad my wounds were, as you say &ldquo;not only just saying that you are slightly wounded&rdquo; would not do such a thing kiddie, eh what. In your letter number 91 you were worrying about my not receiving your parcels but long before now you have heard how well and how many I've received. Very pleased indeed to know that you received the photos okay, those photos will bring back many a good time to my memory in years to come. So you received a telegram regarding my entry into Napstung Hospital. There was certainly something wrong with the wording. The hospital was a grand place and they undoubtedly did everything in their power for me. </p>
<p>Our darling, by every letter I receive, is getting heavier 16 lb now, good stuff he is getting, eh kiddie, he will soon be as heavy as his dad, some kid then. I say Harry Sawyer is going the pace, wait till I get back &ldquo;oh&rdquo; Miss Irene Guthrie. Harry's wedding some class, very humorous, especially your underlinings. They must be wrong in the head, ought to have taken them away in the &ldquo;green cart&rdquo; instead of a motor. </p>
<p>The draft has not yet arrived, badly in need of it, kiddie. The day I left Hurdcott there was a registered letter for me, should have been sent on here. Wrote last Friday for it, no doubt I'll get it in a day or so. You must be in love sweetheart, you said you were enclosing the receipt well I can't find it. Don't think there will be any row between you kiddie and the nurses as far as casting my eyes, that's not in me dear.</p>
<p>Will now ring off, love to all at Regent and Charles Street and sincerely hope they are keeping best of health. Love kisses embraces to my dearest wife and darling bonny baby  from your ever own and loving husband and father with kisses galore.</p>
<p>Hubby and daddy</p>

<p>My own dear wife and bonny son</p>
<p>Have already written 10 letters, so kiddie I'm just about knocked out, but of course will have to write to my sweetheart. Told  you in my last letter that I received the draft okay, sent it on to the bank yesterday and asked them to forward it to Nellie. It's better for her to have it for I can get it much easier. While I'm in England, when sending money do it the same way per draft, but when I'm in France please yourself how to send it. I like to get the draft myself, knowing exactly how I stand. Nellie is very vague regarding money. If I ask her if she has any money for me she always says yes, have an idea that it comes out of her own purse. Anyhow we are square now. </p>
<p>On Thursday I was warned for draft but was pulled off at the last moment &ldquo;swinging it&rdquo;. Suppose next week will tell a tale. Our stay at Heytesbury is very short, five days at the most then over to France. Would very much like to spend Christmas in England, the boys expect general leave then.</p>
<p>Went to the pictures Thursday night, a very good showing indeed. Yesterday I received a few old letters. A mate of mine took charge of them after I was wounded, he being very busy in the line and being wounded himself did not post them until this week from hospital. There was one from your dearest, Number 58, 1Mata, 1 Phyll and 2 from Nellie. Better late than never.
Yesterday afternoon, walked into Warminster and last night went to the pictures. Had an hour or so with George today. He is just back from two days leave had the time of his life, stopped at Hemsleys, Bexley Heath. George is making the most of his stay in England and rightly so. Has quite a number of fine girlfriends. Now this is for yourself darling. A little while ago George received a letter from your mother telling him to be careful regarding the English girls, as there were better girls in Australia. He thought it a great joke, simply brought tears to his eyes laughing when he was telling me. Told me when writing to your mother to put in a Great tale about his English girls. Well I wrote today and made up a bit of a tale. George wanted me to say he had given the girl the ring. Hope your mother will not take it seriously. All the same he has some very fine girl friends, one in particular is a very nice young lady. They are all of good families and highly respectable, no need to worry on that score. He and Sid are having the time of their young lives. George has a host of photos, Think he must collect every girls photo he meets. He is alright leave it to him.</p>
<p>He and Joe Cook met, also he visited Bernie who is still in bed but will be up before Christmas when there is a good time awaiting him. Bernie has had a rough time but I understand there are to be no more operations. Before starting on my correspondence today, did a little washing; handkerchieves, shirts etc. Why are you not here darling to give me a hand. Suppose you would not be able, now that our darling claims so much of your time. The photos of you two darlings are just bonser, wish I could pick darling bub up and give him a kiss. The photo of himself is &lsquo;it&rsquo; can see him better in that, than the other, but the other is grand of you kiddie, both photos are simply lovely. George has received his and we had a good look and talk about his lordship today. Had a real good laugh when I read that you took &lsquo;bubs&rsquo; into the office. Can well imagine how excited they would be, especially the girls. No wonder the little darling laughed at &ldquo;Old Red Davidson&rdquo;, he&rsquo;d make anybody laugh. He is not a bad old sport. Guess Miss Potter was excited. Wait till dad comes home and takes his wife and child there for lunch, that will be the time, eh sweetheart.</p>
<p>Will now say good night love ones, with oceans of love and kisses galore to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever loving husband and father.</p>
<p>Don</p>

<p>My darling wife and bonny son</p>
<p>Monday was another good day for me, kiddie received a batch of 18 letters. From you dear I received six letters, 1 card, 1 from darling &ldquo;bubsie&rdquo;, Don 1 card, Grandma Fry 1 letter, Glen-Ayr Fry&rsquo;s  1 card, Auntie Jane  1 card, Flo Roberts  1 card, Vi  1 card, Phyll two letters, and grandma McDonald's two letters. Simply grand, just bosker receiving them, the Xmas cards were  indeed very good. The numbers of your letters sweetheart are; 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103. Well I told you in my last letter that I was pulled off draft at the last moment but did not state why. Now that I'm more settled will tell you why. </p>
<p>One day walking through the camp I met Bob Watson who is a regimental quartermaster. He said &ldquo;Mac&rsquo; do you want a job that will keep you in England for awhile, of course I said yes. After a terrible lot of bother and &ldquo;pulling of strings&rdquo; I've got a job in charge of the camp coal yards. This position should not be held by myself, on account of me being fit.  A number of men (unfit) were sent here yesterday, to take over the positions held by fit men. Well one of these men is to relieve me, but Bob Watson has got a lot of say with the result this man is to assist  me. Artillery men are also supposed not to have jobs, only infantry, so I'm having a hard fight for it. Anyhow it may only last a few days or it may last months. If I do get kicked out Bob said he thinks he can fix me up with another job. Let's hope so anyhow, eh kiddie. It's a good stunt nothing to do.</p>
<p>I'm practically John Browns representative in Sand Hill Camp.  Kiddie, do not hold out to much hope for my remaining in Blighty although my prospects at present are very bright. It's all due to Bob who has done his darndest for me. Of course if I hold it, it is sure to cost me a few bob so don't be surprised if I send for money. If all turns out well &ldquo;Watts&rdquo; and myself are going to have a small room for our sleeping quarters. He undoubtedly has a lot of influence here and I understand it was he that got George his job. I'm in with the sergeant majors now so therefore I require a few more shillings, it's alright, may keep me in England, for the winter at the least. I'm considering you and bubs kiddie, and I bet you will say quite right and be jolly pleased.
So you two dears  were  in Armidale and appear to be having an enjoyable time, very pleased indeed to hear, wish I could have been with you. Tonight I met Jeff Huysone. Had a good talk over old times. He is expecting to go to France shortly, but hopes to be able to &ldquo;swing it&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Have you won the car yet Kiddie, do me, talk about a trip to the caves, don't mention it. Very pleased to see that Neville is getting his own way regarding getting up in the morning, I would not mind sitting up all night with the little dear, eh what, what do I hear you saying love. Will be looking for the cake Millie made, would come in very handy at present dear. I'm feeling hungry will have to get some supper.</p>
<p>By jove kiddie the sugar tablets will be just the thing when they come. Sugar is very scarce, never have it in our tea. All the parcels that the boys receive contained sugar of some sort. We had some of the tablets in France, bought them off Americans, went okay. George told me yesterday that Fred Street has been killed, do not know for certain whether it is correct. Going off now to get supper, kiddie, I'm just about starving, may have more news in my next letter regarding my job. Hope to be able to say that I&rsquo;ve settled down for the duration. Weather lately has been cold but no snow up to date. There's another draft leaving here on Friday I'm pulled off again. Our battery over in France is out on the line and not going in again until February. Love and kisses galore to my dear sweetheart and darling son with kisses and hugs from your ever own and loving husband and father. </p>

<p>My Darling Wife and Bonny Son</p>
<p>Now for a few lines, kiddie although there's very little to write about, but of course must not neglect my love once, eh dear. Still in my job it's not too bad, gets me free passes to the pictures. Sunday night having nothing to do went to the movies and thoroughly enjoyed them. Monday Tuesday and today have been bitterly cold, water frozen everywhere although it's beautiful in the sun. Yesterday I had a Christmas card from Miss Sutton in the office. Received &pound;2 from Nellie today, the rate I'm going the tenner will soon be gone.&rdquo; The Maitland Girls Patriotic Christmas&rdquo; Parcel received this afternoon. Very nice indeed, can assure you, I greatly appreciated receiving same. Suppose you know what it contained, well in case you don&rsquo;t, lollies, tobacco, sugar, chocolate and milk writing pad, handkerchieves, zig zag chewing gum. Will write to the league one day this week thanking them for it. Went up to see George tonight but he was out, going up again as soon as I finish this letter. </p>
<p>By the way darling what jokes are you putting Nellie up to. She wants to know the meaning of &ldquo;Holy Moses&rdquo;. I'll give it to her, also wants to know about the Patterson affair. In my next letter she will get all the Australian slang to satisfy her.</p>
<p>Kiddie, dear, how is &lsquo;bubs&rsquo; getting on, always thinking of my two darlings. What a great time you must be having with him. You say he is wonderful, he must be more than wonderful the photos are simply lovely, kiddie I would give anything to be back and to have you on one knee and &rsquo;bubs&rsquo; on the other. When I do get home, what a time we will have, eh sweetheart.</p>
<p>The prospect of an early termination of the War are very remote, Russia*  has done it, gives one the hump to think about it. Heard yesterday that some German mines were found off Gab Island, where next will they be found, Farley Harbour no doubt. </p>
<p>Well sweetheart will now say au revoir, hope to have more news in next letter. Love kisses and embraces to my dear little wife and darling son, with heaps of love and oceans of kisses from your ever loving and sincere</p>
<p>Husband and daddy</p>

<p>*Russian Revolution

<p>My dear sweetheart and darling son</p>
<p>Well kiddie, I'm still at Sand Hill and going strong but one never knows when you are likely to slip and have to get a move on. The job is good free passes to the pictures, 11 and 3 o&rsquo;clock, tea  from the cookhouse and as much bread as I  need from the store. Will do me if it lasts. After finishing your last letter love, I made off and picked George up. We first had a cup of tea etc and and then made off to the pictures. George is okay and leading a gay life. Met two Maitland boys here the other day, Alft Prichard and a chap named Bidwell, he married one of the Stubberfield girls. Mum is sure to know of him. Yesterday afternoon I went into Warminster, had a look around and tea at the &ldquo;Bath Arms.&rdquo; Tell you, kiddie it was some tea cost five shillings. Get to go into town for a decent feed sometimes, considering that we are on starvation food. At night went to a show given by the &ldquo;Magpies&rdquo; a concert party from this camp. It was in aid of the hospital. Was going to the pictures tonight missed my mates and being very cold thought the best plan would be to return to the hut, sit by the fire and write a few lines to my dear old sweetheart. Trying to arrange for a few days in Salisbury, a mate of mine Gerry Gerrett wants me to go in badly. He has a staff job there. Wish I could get there with him. The weather is getting cold now, every day lately the water in the pipes has been frozen, but up to the present no signs of snow, may it keep away.</p>
<p>Met Jim Ken while there. Today I received two letters one from Mrs Smith and one from Keith. Mrs Smith is a dear character. She wants to know all about Keith, tells me your letters are the loveliest letters written. Those to me sweetheart undoubtedly are. Keith is okay and having a good time. They are camped near a large town, where they go every night to amusement of different kinds. He has also received a Christmas parcel from the Girls League.
This paper is from the pad which came in my parcels. Wonder what your opinions are concerning the war. Not too bright I should say. The question asked here every day,  is &ldquo;are we winning&rdquo;. General answer, NO. Things look undoubtedly black. Russia has upset everything. Will be interesting to see what the States will do. Tuesday and Wednesday are polling days, the majority of the boys are  voting NO. That's what they say at  any rate. 
&#8232;
Kiddie I have a number of cigarette cards, I suppose Charlie is still saving them, so will enclose a few in each letter. If Charlie does not want them, they're sure to be some kddies that would like them. How is my darling baby getting on? Wish I had him with me now near the fire, would be simply glorious if I had my two love ones over this side with me, what a great time we would have, eh sweetheart. Au revoir for the present darling, Love kisses and embraces to my dear sweetheart and bonny son with oceans and oceans of kisses, your ever own loving and sincere husband and father.</p>
<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX To my two darlings</p>

<p>My Own Dear Wife and Darling son</p>
<p>It is just a week since I last wrote, kiddie, why I've delayed is that I have been working a lot at night, also expected to have some good news for you and been anxiously waiting every day for it. What's the news you want to know, eh kiddie, sorry to say it did not come off. There was a very good job vacant at our headquarters Salisbury which I thought I could get. Will tell you, minutes ago my luck  ran out. It was the job of auditor. Will have to try and square the Dr to mark me C3. Very disappointed better luck next time. Anyhow I had three good days in Salisbury with theatre and good sleep ins, each morning. </p>
<p>Received a letter from Fred Wade the other day, he is in France and going strong. Last Saturday went to Warminster had a look around, a good feed and then home to bed. Sunday afternoon went to the artillery camp at Heytesbury to see some of the boys, suppose it will not be very long and I go to Heytesbury camp. Received a letter from a mate of mine in Salisbury, telling me of the job and for me to apply to headquarters London for it, which I did. Later I received word to interview the officer at Salisbury. Off I went saw him, suited him right down to the ground but my classification A3 was against me. Anyhow he went to London and while there did his best, with the result I missed. C3 men (unfit for active service) is what they want, but they tried several camps with out success. C3 men want to get straight away back to Australia.</p>
<p>Got word just a few falling. Ice everywhere, water taps frozen, sliding here there and everywhere, it's no joke I can assure you. Have been with George a few times lately, he is okay and expects to be going on five days Christmas leave on Sunday. 10% of the men are getting five days Christmas leave and 10% New Years. I'm getting off next week for a few days and hope to go to Bath. I'm in a pretty good home at present 20 blankets makes a good bed, what say you darling. Supper every night. Saturday's supper, potato pie, tea, bread and butter. Sunday grilled steak liver, bacon,  tea, bread and butter. Tuesday soup, steak bread and butter, fruit and tonight we are having salmon, tea and toast etc . It's not too bad I can tell you kiddie. </p>
<p>How is darling Bubs  getting on, every day I get more anxious than ever for the war to end so that I will be able to get back to you dear one, and darling Neville. I can't hurry the end, so will have to wait and wait. Would give all I possess to have dear bubs with me tonight. Kiddie you have no idea how I long to be back  with my two darlings but I always say &ldquo;buck up&rdquo; Mac. </p>
<p>Received a letter from Mrs Suttin at &lsquo;Halls&rdquo;. It contained photos of all the girls etc at the office, also several notes from different ones on the staff. She told me about you sweetheart, being in with bubs and what a beautiful boy, she said just like his father, eh what beautiful. Also got a very old letter from Keith. Have not heard anything yet of his being in Blighty, but expect him any day now. The weather has been bitterly cold of late. Sunday for the first time we had a fall of snow and every day since.</p>
<p>I suppose Neville is getting to be quite a little man, don't put him in long trousers too soon dear one. Fancy Christmas next week how time flies, thought I would be back in Australia by this Christmas, surely next one will see me with my two darlings. Sent the last of my photos away today to Annie and Dorothy Roberts. Fritz has been smashing London up again. </p>
<p>Au revoir for the present with love kisses and embraces to my darling wife and bonny son, with scores and scores of kisses and oceans of love from your ever own and loving husband and father

<p>My own dear  wife and bonny son</p>
<p>Well kiddie Christmas is round again and I'm still away from my loved ones. Never thought this time last year that I would be away for another Christmas. Never mind darling surely I'll be back for the next and what a great time we will have, more especially as we'll have Neville with us. </p>
<p>On Thursday I went into Warminster and sent you a cable, Christmas greetings etc. Hope you receive it on Christmas Day. Would be simply great if you did. On Friday I had a letter from Nellie, also a Christmas cake and pocket diary for 1918. Very good indeed of her. The diary was just what I needed. Fully intended buying one in Warminster yesterday, of course that saved me a few bob. Keeping the cake which is  boska for Christmas. Went into Warminster yesterday and bought a handkerchief which I'm sending to Nellie tonight. While there met George roaming around. He went on five days leave today, staying in Bexley Heath. Have not heard anything of Keith lately, don't think he can be over this side yet. I could have had this week off. Wrote to Nellie for the balance of my money 5/18, received it today. Going to wait until Keith comes over and then hope to spend a week with him. Will try Scotland. If this comes off will have to get the loan of a tenner from the &ldquo;Bank of Love Ltd&rdquo; Manager Nellie Fry. Nellie wants Keith and I to go down there, it's a good way away, anyhow I may go down later on. Have not decided where I'll go this week, maybe Bath. </p>
<p>Wish you dear and bubs were here, would not want to go anywhere, would we darling. Just dig in somewhere, some quiet spot and have a jolly good time. And what a time we would have, to be sure, eh sweetheart.</p>
<p>Sid I understand is going to Goudhurst for Christmas, &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; Nellie thinks so, but Goudhurst is far too slow for Sid, don't blame him either. Have been very busy lately working all days and every night. Have not been to the pictures once this week, that's a record for me in this camp. Our suppers are still going strong. Tonight's menu, grilled steak, bread and butter, toasting cheese. Tell you dear, it goes well. But having it just before going to bed gives  one a nightmare. Last night every one of us had some tall dreams. Mine was good was back in Australia, with you darling, bubs was there but quite different to what I'll expect to find him when I land home once again. You and I were making the pace kiddie, eh what. Nuff said.</p>
<p>Snow has been on the ground for over a week now, not very deep but it's bitterly cold. Today has been the mildest day of the week, sun is shining and a beautiful moon tonight. Good night for a raid. No doubt Fritz will make the most of it. </p>
<p>Au revoir for the present darling. Sincerely hope you'll have a very enjoyable Christmas. Wonder what you will put in bubs sock. Waiting until next Christmas. Supper is getting ready can smell the steak, it smells okay. What about having some with me darling. Could easily get some condensed milk for bugs. No need for that, mother could fix him up. What can I hear you saying, give me a smack where? On the lips to be sure!
Love kisses and embraces to my darling sweetheart wife and bonny son from your ever own hubby and father with oceans and oceans of kisses and love.</p>
<p>Your loving husband and daddy</p>

<p>It is Christmas day sweetheart, and have had a fairly good day. Could not let the day pass without writing to my dear ones. Majority of the boys spent Christmas Eve drinking. They came home in a very happy mood. The jokes they got up to, laugh never laughed more in my life. My body is sore from laughing. Myself and another chap remained at home I wrote to mum and Phyll. The weather today was beautiful, not a cloud in the sky. </p>
<p>The chief item of the day, as always is meals. 
Well breakfast; ham, savaloys, bread butter jam and tea.
Dinner; Turkey, ham, potatoes, peas, cabbage, parsnips, (sauce salt pepper mustard) plum pudding with brandy sauce, finished up with beer for the drinks and ginger ale for the &ldquo;woses&rsquo;.
Tea; bread butter, jam, pineapple and custard, pastry.
The meals could not have been much better, what say you darling, everything went off okay. This afternoon four of us went for a walk to Kingston Deverill about 4 miles away had a good afternoon tea and returned to camp about 7 PM. It's 9:30 now so feeling fit for supper. Supper tonight consists of ham cheese and toast and cake. </p>
<p>Will be working for a few hours in the morning and then off for the day. Have no idea at present where I'm going. Saving my money until Keith comes over when I hope to be able to spend a few days with him, Scotland most likely. Tomorrow there's a large sports programme for the troops here, afraid there will be very few men present. Sweetheart this time last year never thought I'd spend this Christmas in camp thought it would have been spent in Australia with you dear heart and our darling baby. Sincerely hope and pray that we three will be spending next Christmas together. What a time we'll have eh sweetheart. Wrote you on Sunday kiddie so therefore I have little news to write about. Today I received the card from Mrs Crowley. I sent her one during the week. What sort of a Christmas did you give darling bubs, wish I could have shared it with you dear, giving him as good  a time as possible for the dear kid. Next Christmas I'll make a good Father Christmas. The issue of beer today was very liberal, too much so at present I can hear a terrible row outside, too much beer.</p>
<p>Au revoir for the present darling surely I'll be back this time next year with you two dear ones. Sincerely hope and trust you all spent a jolly merry time, also that my cable reached you today. Love kisses and embraces to my dear wife and darling son from your ever own and loving husband and father.</p>

		<p>My Own Dear Wife and Bonny Son
Been having our share of cold weather lately, plenty of snow and ice about but today it's much milder, raining slightly. So kiddie considering the state of the weather, think it best to sit near the fire and write to my two darlings. Have a few other letters to write as well, Nellie, Sid and the grandmas. Keith has not yet put in an appearance, hope he hangs up for another fortnight, when I expect to be getting our week off. Scotland will certainly be my objective. What about taking the trip with me darling, bet we would give Neville a good time, eh what! and have a great time ourselves to be sure.</p>
	</div><!-- end class='letter_header'-->
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Thursday I received a letter from Dorothy, said she had two letters and parcel for Keith, wanted to know what to do with them, as she was expecting him over. Told her to hang onto them. He must be over here any day now. Also received the photo  &ldquo;Bubs&rdquo; from grandma. It's a boska, tell you darling I was overjoyed to receive it. Isn't he a bonny kid. Will this war never end so as to allow me to get back to my darling. I have great hopes of settlement in the near future, going home to my love ones.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had the good fortune to receive a parcel from Pyll, tell you we made way into it last night. Make quite a number of old pals in Warminster yesterday, &ldquo;Benalla boys&rdquo; there was great talking going on. Warminster is a great place to meet friends, the reason being all the Australian camps are situated nearby. For this military district there are 22 Australian camps. Returned to camp about 6 o&rsquo;clock, sat around the fire, smoking and telling the yarns, had supper and turned into bed about 9:30. Just received a letter from Nellie saying she had received &pound;20, a tenner for George and myself. Just the thing sweetheart, very pleased indeed to get it. Now there is no doubt about my not having a good time in Scotland. Have a few pounds in my belt so that together with my pay (have not drawn any pay for over six weeks) and the tenner they'll be something doing. Why are you sweetheart and bubs, not with me. Wait till I return then there's sure to be something doing. Also received a &ldquo;Christmas letter&rdquo; from Frank E Fry. In case you were wondering what has become of the tobacco pouch that Vi gave me, well, I've still got it and it's doing great work. Never been out of my pocket since the day I got it. You remember the blue silk flag  I waved leaving Sydney, still in my pocket. Brings back memories. I'll wave it on my return, kiddie. What a day that will be. Nellie is it a dead character, goes in raptures  over  &ldquo;Bubs&rdquo; photos. She passes all sorts of remarks. Said she received the photos, but grandma tops it with a &ldquo;superb&rdquo; picture. </p>
<p>In one of your letters you said seed had &pound;2 for me, well I've heard nothing more about it, so going to drop him a line straightaway. Bet your live I'll make good use of it.</p>
<p>Well darling I'll ring off now. Remember me to all our friends. Love to all at Regent and Charles Streets. Hope all  are keeping in best of health. I&rsquo;m grand. Love kisses any embraces to my own dear wife and darling son from your ever loving husband and father with oceans and oceans of love and kisses.</p>

<p>How are my two darlings getting on, sincerely hope okay. I&rsquo;m just &lsquo;it&rsquo; and going strong. Kiddie for the last couple of months I've not been putting stamps on your envelopes, let me know if you get them alright.  There is no reason why you should not receive them. Have you never missed writing, every week in fact, there have been weeks when I've written three or four times. Last Monday have a letter from Annie Roberts, wishes to be remembered to all at home. Also receive two from Keith, has not yet got his leave. He had a grand time at Christmas and the new year. The poor kid is suffering from chilblains on the feet, said he had no idea chilblains could be so bad. I wrote to Sid asking him about the &pound;2, received a reply from him yesterday enclosing the two notes. He has forwarded Georges &pound;5 to Nellie. Darling I had a real good day yesterday, received five of your loving letters, one from dear &lsquo;bubs&rsquo; just lovely, one each from Jean and May Goodsir. The numbers of the letters sweetheart are 104, 108, 109, 110, 111 and 112. So poor &lsquo;Bubs&rsquo; is starting to suffer from his teeth, look after him kiddie. Yes sweetheart I received your and Bubs kisses on 4 November. Remember quite well a funny feeling on my lips that day. There's I locked I'll talk about the Australians being relieved by the Americans and transferring to Mesopotamia and Egypt. It's only a rumour, but it is welcomed by the boys. You are rough sport saying Bubs has a large mouth like his dad. That beats the band, like his mother, for you had a beauty, eh what. You cannot tell me too much about Bubs, dear, the more the better, my love one. The cake with &lsquo;love from Wadhurst&rsquo; has not yet arrived, will be welcome when it does, I can assure you. Anxiously waiting for Bubs parcel. Pleased to hear you got a post card album, when I return and looking over them will be able to tell you some good tales, the truth, I assure you. Guess you'll be some class at the wedding, wish I were with you sweetheart. Wait till we have our second honeymoon, kiddie. The postcards are just the thing, very good indeed. But wait till I get home, you'll get up &lsquo;bosca&rsquo; smack on the&hellip;&hellip;? lips of course and on the &hellip;.. also. Bubs writing takes the bun, no wonder he yelled when doing it. Fancy taking a photo of Bubs sitting on there jerry. That's the time he should have kicked up a noise. All the same, I'd like to have seen the little darling. The photos enclosed are glorious, how I wish I could be nursing him. Suppose my turn will come, eh sweetheart sooner the better for me. The one taken with Vi  Is very good, both are in a happy mood. They are all very good of Bubs, but one of you kiddie, you seem to be in a very bad mood. I should be there to fix you up. The second one of you is undoubtedly good. Wish I were nursing the two of you right now. Well darling I'll now ring off. Supper is just about ready. Grilled steak tonight.</p>
<p>Kind regards to wall friends Love to Charles and Regent Street folks. Love and kisses galore to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever own and loving husband and father.</p>

<p>The postcards which you sent Bubs are just the thing. Of course I never been like the man on the cards, all the same I don't think it's too bad of a complaint these times. Your mum is very naughty saying you are a dirty boy, so next time you are doing some cake walking on her tummy, give an extra kick from me,  hard as you like.</p>
<p>Had a letter from Keith, not in Blighty yet, soon as he arrives, I'm off for a few days. The weather here at present is fairly mild, but Nellie tells me that down their way it is 18&deg;, frost, pipes broken, no hot water.</p>
<p>Bernie was on his way to Kent the other week, was in London walking along the Strand when he slipped and fell on his stump. Taken to St George's Hospital for a week and then taken back to Southall. This will put him back a couple of months. Most unfortunate and I feel very sorry for him. </p>
<p>Yesterday I had a glorious day, letters from dad, mum, Harry Curtis  (card) grandpa and grandma Fry, Madge, Phyll 2 and yourself sweetheart 3. The numbers kiddie are 107, 113, 114. Also dear I received the cake and Neville&rsquo;s parcel just grand. The cake could not have been in better condition, the icing was broken a little at the edges but the wording was as good as the day it was put on. Tell you the boys and myself greatly appreciated it last night, a feed of decent cake. Darling Bubs parcel was okay except for one broken cigar. That's very good, could not expect anything better than that eh kiddie. And the contents, just what's needed. The ginger has disappeared, half the biscuits, coffee and milk we had for supper last night. Tell you darling we had a great feast. The cigars will do when on my trip to Scotland, some swank, eh what. Not too much of the fancy work &lsquo;sports&rdquo;. They wanted me to have a go at it while in hospital, no thank you, books and papers were more in my line.</p>
<p>Fancy Uncle Charlie Fry marrying again, how&rsquo;s Aunt Minnie, dear old soul. Would like to have been under the bed on the first night. Wonder was there anything doing.</p>
<p>I'm awfully pleased to hear you are getting my letters etc okay. Can just imagine you love receiving 40 parcels and seven letters. The bulletin that came in the parcel and the Mercury around the cake have been read from beginning to end. Quite a sensation among the boys when the Bulletin came to light. The photos enclosed are just okay. Bubs in the chair is great, how I wish I could give him a huge kiss. No kiddie I&rsquo;d never spoil him, never, eh what. But sweetheart why don't you part his hair. The garden looks good, wish I were there now kiddie rolling on the grass with Bubs, to say nothing of his mother. I'm grand, hope darling Bubs and yourself the same. Love and tons of kisses to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever own loving husband and father.</p>

<p>Received your very welcomed letter dated November 11th  about a fortnight ago. I'm still going strong in this camp although things are very unsettled this week.. Hundreds have been warned for draft. We are only suppose to remain here three weeks, then overseas but of course these orders can be twisted  when ones in the know. Anyhow my time for leaving might come any day now. Keith is in England at present on 14 days leave. We have been together for a few hours.</p>
<p>I just returned from a weeks trip to Edinburgh. Keith was to have come with me but somehow he was nowhere to be seen when the train was due to leave. Scotland is a great place and needless to say  I had the time of my life. Visited all places of interest including Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, St Giles Cathedral, Firth Bridge etc. Went to Keith and saw a naval ship building yard. The trip up the Firth of Forth was very fine. Also had a day and night in London.</p>
<p>Looking forward to my next leave, Scotland will do me.</p>
<p>Love to all. Hope all are okay.</p>

	</div><!-- end class='letter_header'-->
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Back again in France, after a glorious time in Blighty. I have not joined the units yet. They are now moving up and expect I will meet them tomorrow. If I had been allowed to come back the way I desired I would have been with them now. </p>
<p>My intentions were good when in England that was towards the letter writing. I expected to write quite a number, at the time was or appeared to be awfully short and I was dreadfully busy. Expect Don has told you that I went to Warminster, spent the night with him, also that we made arrangements to go to Scotland together. We decided to go up on Friday night. Well I met all trains leaving for Scotland but unfortunately did not see Don.. As I did not see him I did not feel like going up that night, so decided to go up to Scotland the following day, Saturday. Saturday came, but I did not get out I had a ton of luck that day. One never knows his luck in a big city.</p>
<p>Being anxious to go to Scotland I persuaded myself that whatever happened to go on Sunday morning. I got away early on Sunday morning at about 11 o'clock found the Scotland but got fed up of train travelling and broke the journey at Newcastle. I spent a couple of days in Newcastle, then went on to Edinburgh and then to Glasgow. At Glasgow I had a horribly decent time and left there on Thursday night (after doing a theatre) for London. I might have stayed longer in Glasgow but had to fulfill arrangements in London. I arrived in London at 8 o'clock o'clock Friday morning and as it was the last day of my leave I had a hundred and one things to do.</p>
<p>On Friday night had a look at The Maid of the Mountains at Daly&rsquo;s Theatre an, awfully jolly thing then ended a perfect day at 3 AM Saturday morning. As the train left for France at 6 AM I had only a few hours sleep and believe me it was not half hard having to leave.</p>
<p>All I am looking forward to now another Blighty but suppose it will be some look.</p>
<p>Received a letter from you when in England, also the photo of the nipper. I had been dwelling on a photo for sometime.
I have a few more letters dragging which need a reply so I must now conclude this note.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately</p>
<p>Keith</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon all dressed up and nowhere to go. There is Warminster to go to but thought I'd stay in camp and write a few lines to my darlings. Was raining here this morning but the afternoon has turned out beautiful and fine. Tonight I think I'll go to the pictures. Pictures and concerts in the YMCA are the only amusements, the concerts at times are exceedingly good. The weather is still keeping mild we are sure to get more cold weather, no doubt it will be a late winter. I told you all about Keith being in Blighty and our missing one another when going to Scotland. Well I received a letter from him last Tuesday, telling me about his trip north. Fancy the two of us in Edinburgh at the same time, then to miss one another, bad luck, what say you kiddie. He said he went to all of the trains on the day I went up and could not see I sign of me so waited until the next day expecting a wire or letter. All I can say is he must've been drunk or not there at all. Have written him saying then I'm sure he must have had a girl and that she was the cause of our missing one another. When he replies can just imagine what he'll have to say. Well he first went to Newcastle for a day, then to Edinburgh for a couple of days, then onto Glasgow. He had a great time in Scotland and returned to London where he finished up in great style. He is going to write later giving full particulars of his trip.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I received the Newcastle Herald from Phyll, grand having had a look over the old rag. Had a letter from Dorothy the other day, said that Keith had been staying there, how well he looked. Gave the two girls Dot and Helen a good time, took them to dinner then to the Palace Theatre to see &ldquo;Pamela&rdquo; and supper afterwards..Said he was grand their outing was simply great.</p>
<p>Fritz has been over London a good deal lately but no bombs were dropped out Roberts&rsquo; way. All the same they were greatly excited and nervy. No doubt you have read a good deal lately regarding the strikes in Germany. Our hopes are that the reports are true but up to the present it&rsquo;s not serious and not near as bad as some of the papers paint it. The leading papers here are saying very little about the strike, for the news received cannot be taken seriously as it does not come from a good source. The military power in Germany is too strong and it's people are sure they are winning.  Let us hope the strike spreads and by so doing peace Wellcome very much quicker.</p>
<p>Darling yesterday I received one of your loving letters number 115 and dated 28/11/17. There must be some more hanging about so I am anxiously waiting for the afternoon's mail. Sure to be some more from my darling little wife.</p>
<p>Kiddie I am ashamed of you and very annoyed, no laughing matter, it's a fact. What do you want to smack Bubs for, shahid was not to blame, you say he has paddy and played up &ldquo;Holy smokes&rdquo; don't believe you, impossible. Suppose the poor kid did think it was a fly. Wait till I get home and  by jove you'll get more than one smack, one on the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; one on the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;and hundreds on the lips, that will be the time, eh sweetheart. So you had your fortune told well all I hope is that next July or August will see me home with my two darlings. By jove the sooner that time comes the better and what a  time we will have, another honeymoon to be sure, what say you, kiddie. Makes my mouth water to think of it. Where will we go sweetheart. Conditions here are not too bad, hundreds of the boys have gone on draft lately though but I'm still safe. Of course one never knows when their time is coming. Of course if I can remain here, bet your sweet life I'll do my best to remain. Our supplies are still going strong, last night we had steak and ham, toast bread and butter, potted paste, pineapple and cheese. Tomorrow I start having my meals at the officers mess. So things will be okay. My job in camp is just the thing, five camps to look after. I'm known by everybody as &rdquo;Old King Cole&rdquo;
. Well darling sweetheart there's no more news so will ring off. Love and kisses to my dear wife and bonny son from your ever own and loving husband and father with scores and scores of kisses and oceans of love.</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>Bubs if mum hits you kick up a noise, howl and make a great fuss. You are not to be hit but of course you must not be a naughty boy. When you go to bed tonight give mum a big kick for me.</p>
<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX    to my darling wife and bonny son</p>

<p>I read your mummy I long letter  last night. Shortly after writing it along came a beautiful cake and a postcard from Madge. Will you give mum a big hug and kiss for me. The cake was beautiful and fresh, nearly finished it at supper last night. Talk about supper, this is what I had, tomato soup, salmon, some tongue, then a dish of OXO, two pieces of toast one piece of bread and cheese and finish with three slices of cake. Not a bad feed, think it was an attempt to see who could eat the most, anyhow it was a dead heat. Well talking to your uncle George this morning he is grand and going strong. Had a letter from Auntie Jane this morning. </p>
<p>My word, my boy, mummy has been telling me you have a &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; and kick up a terrible noise, of course I don't believe her, anyhow you are boss, so do as you like and see that you get everything you want. Next time you are doing a cake walk on mummy&rsquo;s  &hellip;.. stamp and kick like the very &lsquo;duce&rsquo; and don't forget an extra  one for me. Hope you are a real good boy, Tons of kisses and oceans of love to you and mummy.</p>

<p>Joy in the camp on Tuesday, four of your loving letters arrived numbers 116, 117, 118 and 119. Also received letters from Daph, Vi, Phyll, and two from mum, so I&rsquo;ve got a few letters to answer. Working hard in every day this week, at night always dog tired, does not take me long before turning into bed and sleep don't mention it. But bet your life there would be no sleep if you were with me darling would there? </p>
<p>Has been raining heavily the last few days but has cleared up tonight. Fancy that Mater spraining her ankle, trying to appear too young, it's no good, she's getting old now. &ldquo;Grandma&rdquo;.
She sure to go crook when you tell her what I've said. Why did you not win &ldquo;the nighty&rdquo; bet your life kiddie, no matter what it was made of, better if there was none at all, what can I hear you say not &lsquo;naughty&rdquo; but &ldquo;loving&rdquo;. What time we will have when we get together again, eh darling. Regarding my photo sweetheart Bubs owns it, learn and inwardly digest Bubs owns it. </p>
<p>Long before this you must have received a letter from me explaining why the Attorney General would not cable for money. Anyhow your money sent, arrived okay and came in very handy too darling. Still got enough money to take me to Scotland again, soon as my &ldquo;luck leave&rdquo; comes along. Of all the places I've visited Edinburgh stands out on its own, just like being among Australian people again, far different to English towns. But all this saying give me the old Maitland and my two ones and home folk. It may not be very long and I'm home darling with you and Bonny Nev. </p>
<p>Can just imagine Joe Chant regarding the arrival of another girl better luck next time. Our next ought to be twins&hellip;&hellip;.. Teddy Young&rsquo;s enlisting and getting 12 months exemption, is the funniest thing I've ever heard. I don't wish to pass any remarks but you can well imagine my thoughts. So your letter number 118 was written from Toronto. How I would like to be with you and Bubs, what a great time we would have, wait till I return Sweetheart. Anxiously waiting for a letter from Nellie expressing her views regarding the name &ldquo;Fairmead&rdquo; well I imagine what she will say, Nellie does not like the name &ldquo;Fairmead&rdquo; at all she's a character without a doubt.</p>
<p>Look Nev dear.  Mummy is always telling me you have a &ldquo;paddy&rdquo; of course I don't believe it, take my advice and just  for spite play up like the very devil. But of course don't be naughty boy. No laughing matter Neita my girl. Nothing startling has happened here lately. Have started having my meals at the officers mess, tell you kiddie it's not too bad. Have not had any further news from Keith suppose he has not yet settled down after his leave. No doubt the conscription issue was very disappointing to you all, to say nothing of our feelings. Billy Hughes is not the right man. If the National party went to the country with the same policy but a strong man at the head, a man who says a thing and carries it through instead of twisting and shuffling conscription would have been carried.</p>
<p>What darling I&rsquo;ll now ring off. I'm okay feeling grand hope you and Bubs are the same. Kind regards to all friends, love to Regent and Charles Street folk.</p>
<p>Love kisses and embraces to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever loving father and husband, kisses galore and oceans of love.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon and no little wifey or son to go walking with. It's a beautiful afternoon, would it not be grand kiddie if we three could be going for a stroll along some of the beautiful English lanes. Bet there would be something more then walking doing eh sweetheart. There are several very fine walks about here, but give me the Sunday afternoon walk round old Maitland, it will do me. </p>
<p>Yesterday we had a big muster parade for the purpose of finding all the spare parts. A couple of hundred were caught, men who attached themselves to staff companys, simply did nothing but walked round the camp, playing cards and drinking etc. 
Went to the pictures last night very good indeed, very likely will go again tonight of course having a pass, one is able to do it well. I'm doing well for meals, feeding on the best of the land, as long as it lasts things will be &ldquo;good eh&rdquo;. </p>
<p>No mail of any description received this week, have been doing very well for letters up till lately so to miss for a week is too bad. There is mail in so certain that there will be letters from my darling sweetheart. Have not heard anything lately regarding our camp moving, appears as if the thing has fallen through. This letter should reach you  about 11th March, kiddie dear I wish you &ldquo;Many Happy Returns of the Day, with all my heart. Surely to goodness I'll be home for your next birthday, then, dear we will have to make up for the birthdays I've been away, what say you dearest. Georgie is still in his job in the Q.M. store and going strong. He is looking well and keeping best of health. </p>
<p>Things are very quiet over at the front, great things are expected any day, but by todays papers they hear that Fritz won't be ready to take the offensive for another fortnight. Anyhow the month of February will see some of the worst fighting. The weather over there is good, it's to be sincerely hoped  that it continues so. No word from Keith lately, going to send him some cigarettes tomorrow. Jerry said he had practically slept between sheets the whole time he's been in France. Boards at a private houses, on one occasion he paid 5 francs and on another t 3 francs per week. Had a room to himself and bought the provisions to the old lady who did all the cooking, treated him like a &ldquo;mother&rdquo; he's been having a glorious time.</p>
<p>Well now ring off dear, with love kisses and embraces to my darling wife and bonny son with kisses galore and oceans of love.</p>
<p>Your ever loving husband and father</p>

<p>Well kiddie I'm here in this camp although hanging on by the &ldquo;skin of my teeth,&rdquo;  scores and scores of the staff men have gone overseas during the past week, very lucky to be left I can assure you. My turn will come shortly no doubt. Every available fit man is being sent to France, getting ready for the great offensive. It was expected to have started long ere this, it's a case of both sides waiting for the other to start. </p>
<p>Last night we had a very heavy frost, naturally very cold this morning, the day is beautiful and fine, I walk would just be grand with you sweetheart and Bubs, as you two dear ones are not here decided to remain in doors and write. By jove sweetheart in years to come, when we take a trip to the &ldquo;old dart&rdquo; it will be just glorious going round having a look at the old places.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon I did not go anywhere had a slight headache so sat round the fire and turned into bed early. Word has just been received that all men, artillery, lighthorse etc   (detail men) are to be relieved of their duties so suppose yours truly will be on the way shortly, bad luck eh dearest, all the same I've had a good spell. </p>
<p>Have not had any word from Keith lately, you'll be okay. Sent him a couple of packets of cigarettes early in the week, he  is sure to find use for them. Had a game of cards  the other night, first game for ages. Remember the games of 500 we had, wish we were all playing again tonight. Mrs Smith wrote me a letter the other day she sent it to Nellie to readdress thinking I had &lsquo;gone out&rsquo; again. Nellie also wrote a few lines. Mrs Smith wants me to go and spend a few days if I have not gone over to France. Don't think I'll be able to go, it's such a long way out. Will have to drop her a line and explain matters George and Sid okay. Sid has changed his address, nearer to here but still a long way off. Bernie is better so Nellie tells me, but won't get up, from that, I take it, that he still confined to his bed. Of course Nellie wants me to pat them another visit very badly, will do so the first opportunity.</p>
<p>I've been expecting letters from you every day lately but no Australian mail, suppose they will come all in a bunch one of these fine days and may that day hurry up. It seems ages since I've had one of your letters sweetheart, well it's just on a fortnight, too long, to wait for my darlings letters, I suppose I'll have to wait and be good. Good why I'm always good, am I not dearest, you know only too well how good I am, is fact there are times when you would like me to be bad eh darling, not for me, eh what&hellip;..</p>
<p>How is my dear boy Bubs getting on. Darling I wonder if you realise how I want to get back to see the little darling. Of course you do and I pray the day won't be long ere I&rsquo;m on the homeward journey. The day I enter Sydney Harbour wanted a day that will be. What oh the night, &ldquo;nuff said&rdquo; Kiddie I have a letter to write to Nellie, Mrs Smith, mum, and Phyll so think I had better ring off and get a start on theirs.
Au revoir for the present. Kind regards to all friends. Love to Regent and Charles Street folk.
Love kisses and embraces to my darling little wife and precious son from your ever own and loving husband and father with kisses galore and oceans of love.</p>

<p>Just after posting your letter on Sunday I received a great and joyful surprise, the postman walked in and handed me 12 letters, just lovely. Talk about excited no name for a kiddie. 8 were from you darling, 1 mum,1 Phyll, 1 Daph, and 1 from &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; Fry. On Monday I had another day of days, two parcels came to hand, one from Mater and a cake from my darling son. The Maters parcel contained just the things I needed, hence very very welcome. The cake was bonza, in excellent condition, the wording&rdquo; With love to dad from little Don&rdquo; was not broken at all except for the &ldquo;D&rdquo; in  Don. It's all gone so that speaks for itself. </p>
<p>It is marvellous how fresh cakes keep considering the trip of 14,000 miles. Had a letter from Keith today, he is grand. Was speaking to George today, expects to be going on leave tomorrow for two days. Ran across Jack Ken today, he is returning to France later in the week. Saw a photo of Mrs Hewitt and her baby girl this afternoon, very good indeed, she looks very well to say nothing of the baby a fine little girl. The numbers of your letters sweetheart our 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, and 128, that's a good straight run what say you darling? You appear to be having a good time at the lake, why can't I get back and join you in having a good time. Now mind darling when I return we will make up for it, make the pace some eh kiddie. Won&rsquo;t Bubs have a good time, oh don't mention it. Its glorious to read in your letters that both you and darling Neville are keeping best of health. Can assure you it is a great relief to know my two darlings are better than okay. Something will be doing at the Sydney, bet your sweet life. Your question kiddie &ldquo;Who are you going to kiss first Me or Bubsie&rdquo; requires answering. Well dear, don&rsquo;t think I will answer it, wait till I return then we will see. The best way out of it will be for you both to kiss me at the same time. But I'll make such a bull dog rush at you both, that we will be all sixes and sevens. Anyhow take one each now X X. By jove I wish I could see Bubsie in the water, I'm dying to get back to see him, but of course I'll have to wait and be contented, although it's very hard to be contented with this military life. Soldiering is not in my line, I want to be with my two dears, that and our own &ldquo;home sweet home&rdquo; is the life for me.</p>
<p>No, kiddie you did not tell me, you enclosed a pair of socks from Mrs Price. Will certainly drop her a line one of these days. So Elsie is engaged, good luck to her, tell her from me to get spliced straight away, don't delay, there's nothing like it, married life I mean. </p>
<p>You appear very disappointed with the conscription issue and rightly so. Cannot make out what the country is coming to. Reinforcements are needed and badly needed. The result is a disgrace to the Australian empire. Certainly there are a number of reasons against conscription but the reasons are tenfold more. Conscription it should be. </p>
<p>Yes kiddie your Christmas cards are some class, very nice indeed, the wording good, some class my wife. Pleased to hear you receive my photo. The snaps that Nellie sent you are awful. I'm better looking than they indicate, you know that well dear.</p>
<p>The photos you sent are simply great, showed them to George today, he thought Bubs just it. Bubs in the act of yawning is grand, wish I could stick a lump of lolly in his mouth. All the photos of Bubs are jolly fine, especially the ones having a bath. He&rsquo;s got a bonny grin. He's a bonny kid. The group photo is good, except you kiddie, look like if you&rsquo;d taken are willie. Will send them on to Nellie in a day or so, but if she does not return them well, Nellie had better look out. She won't keep them, she's not game. The Mater in her letter said she and Phyllis were, going down to Toronto for a few days, very pleased to hear this, for I'm sure she needed a wash. If mum got into the water it would be good night Toronto.</p>
<p>Dear ones supper is just about ready so will now say good night and happy dreams. Oceans of love and kisses galore to my darling son and darling wife XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX from your ever own loving husband and Dada we've are a few extra specials
XXXXXXX loving husband and father XXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>

<p>Note the new address. Had a terrible slip, my good time has come to an end very sorry to say. On Monday word came to Sand Hill Camp that any artillery men had to go in the draft immediately. </p>
<p>How the trouble arose was an artillery chap was put on guard against his wishes, he the fool wrote to Birdwood and complained  with the result word came through that we all had to leave.
Talk about a stir there is no name for it. Not one me man was was left in his job. I try my hardest to miss the draft but no luck. Two officers tried their hardest for me but the Brigadier said it was a definite order from the General so that was the end of it.</p>
<p>Well kiddie you can well imagine my disappointment, but had to make the most of it. It took them a whole day to find me but when they did no mistake was made.</p>
<p>Saturday, 9 March
Darling you see I&rsquo;ve knocked off and started this letter again. This is a rotten camp, food  very poor indeed. What sooner be in France than remaining in this present camp. Had a go to get into the signal school, no luck the OC of our battery what not grant a transfer because being to France once I&rsquo;ve got to get back again as soon as possible. No rest for men who have been over there. Friday morning I was warned to proceeds overseas next Tuesday but the dentist pulled  me off, have to get a few teeth stopped. That means a delay of about a week. No doubt now that with the changed camp my mail will be hung up. Two day I received a parcel from Nellie I does and fresh eggs have a feed tonight to be sure. Also got a letter from her mentioned having received a letter from George written at Southhampton. Charlie Tailer has spent a couple of days at Fairmead. Bernie has to undergo another operation his  leg is much swollen, a piece of dead bone has to be removed. Poor Bernie he is having a very tough time. On my way through Harve to the line I'll try and see Harry Beardson do not think there's much chance for our stay at Harve is for only about 24 hours. I&rsquo;ve sent all my private belongings to Nellie. Intentionally sending my watch to her. Something has gone wrong with it still keeps good time but the parts which turns the hands round won't work. It's no use taking you to France in that condition have not got enough time before leaving to get it repaired. </p>
<p>How are you sweetheart and darling Bubs getting on. Had a real dream about Bubs the other night. I was home among you all and Bubs was running about large as life. But the  troubling part of it was, he was running after your father saying dad dad. This is your dad pointing to me but the poor kid  could not make head or tail out of it. Tell you, I was very annoyed. 
By jove sweetheart. Life in this camp is quite different to Sand Hill, it was home, without a doubt. This place is enough to break any man's heart.</p>
<p>Darling another parcel of yours came to hand at Sandhill. I left the day after it arrived, no doubt it will catch me up in a few days time. Feel very unsettled so sweetheart please excuse if this letter is not up to the mark. How do you like the state of things over this way. Things don't look very bright I can assure you. Fritz seems to be getting stronger every day, instead of getting back to France would be better if we were returning to my two darlings but never mind dearest there'll come a time some day when I'll be making my way through Sydney heads and what you today that will be. Don't mention it eh darling. All our batteries in France are 25% over strength and at the present rate of things they will soon be 50% okay. The draft to leave here Friday is about 750 strong. Reinforcements are not coming from Australia so it won't be long ere our camps are empty. Fully expected to have had another few days leave . No hope now will have to try Paris for my next stunt.</p>
<p>Will now ring off sweetheart tons and tons of love and kisses galore to my darling wife and bonny son your own loving hubby and daddy with the oceans of love and kisses XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX </p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Since writing your last letter which was Thursday, I've received your everloving letter number 132, which contained the photos of Bubs and Doris Fry,  also three parcles, one from your dear self containing socks, handkerchiefs, biscuits, milk, ginger etc etc tin of peaches. Thanks to your mum and again thanks to your dad. A cake each from Auntie Jane and Auntie Von. They were both in first-class condition, the icing on Auntie Fons being only cracked slightly, the wording &ldquo;Greetings from Auntie Fon&rdquo; was as good as the day it was put on. Tell you the cakes soon found a dark passage down our necks. The photo of dear Bubs and Doris is just bonza simply lovely. What a darling kid. Why can't I get home. Have the photo in front of me at present, wish I had Bubs sitting on the table in front of me. Very pleased to hear that  Bubs can say &lsquo;mama&rsquo;, suppose in your next letter you'll be advising me that he can swear. The army is the place to be educated on the art of swearing. Of course sweetheart don't for a moment think I do, why your hubby could not do such thing. </p>
<p>So Vera Roulston is going to take up house keeping, good luck to them, lucky beggars.&rdquo;Babe&rdquo; Nicholson is to be married, how many more Maitlanders are there going off, strikes me it is a wise policy for our boys to marry over this side for I'm afraid there will be no single girls left when they return. You say things are very dear, you ought to be over this side. Food particularly is very scarce. When the boys go on leave they have to take their rations with them such as sugar, tea, butter and meat. It's almost impossible to get anything otherwise.</p>
<p>Well darling I'm off to France again next week, unless pulled off by the dentist. Do not think this is likely as I&rsquo;ve only a small job to be done. Have sent two parcels containing clothes to Nellie, also sending another today, including my watch which has the screw which turns the hands broken. It's practically useless taking in overseas.</p>
<p>Bernie is getting on well, down with Nelly this week. No news of George or Keith lately. Darling it is just about tea time so I'll ring off, well write again tomorrow. Of course there's no news to tell but as long as it's letter, eh sweetheart. Look after Bubs and don't you smack him or when I get home, look out, you'll get a few smacks on the &hellip;.. and the lips to be sure, eh darling.
Love kisses and embraces to my darling wife and precious son, from your ever own and loving husband and father we the oceans of love and kisses galore.</p>

		<p>Dear Father
Thanks very much for your letter dated 6th January which I received last Thursday. Yesterday I received a parcel from Neita which included your cigars. Thanks very much indeed they are &ldquo;tray bong&rdquo;, not one broken and at present I'm smoking one and thoroughly enjoying it. Neita has told me all about your holiday at Toronto what a great time you had, lucky people. What about letting Neita, Bubs and to myself have the cottage next Easter, of course we might invite you down, there is a chance. The photos of Bubs and yourself are very good, you certainly do look to be having a good time, what about changing places. Very sorry regarding the conscription issue. The Irish over this side were up against it, why? goodness only knows. They would like to see England fall, they don't consider the consequences. I am returning to France next week sometime. This is a rotten camp, glad in one way to get out of it. Bernie is getting on fine, and He has been down at &ldquo;Fairmead&rdquo; lately. Have not heard anything of George since going overseas. Hope yourself and all at Wadhurst are keeping in best of health. Love and kisses to dear Bubs and Neita.</p>

<p>Just a line kiddie,  &rdquo;Waiting for the train to Southampton&rdquo; then on to France. It will certainly be days before I have the chance of writing again. Wrote you a number of letters lately, one every day. Hope you receive them. Received a Christmas gift this morning tobacco, lollies, sugar, handkerchieves from the Comfort Gard. I card was inside indicating that it was sent by Doris Backland, Hunters Hill Sydney. May drop her a line acknowledging this gift. It's a request of the Comfort Gard to acknowledge the gifts. Had a letter from Nellie last night, Bernie has been staying there for 6 days. He is grand although worries a little about his leg. She also received a note from George. Arrived France okay.
Au revoir for the present darling. Love kisses and embraces to my darling wife and precious son with oceans of love and kisses galore from your very own loving husband and father.</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Your husband was under my care for the very short time he was in hospital. He was admitted suffering from influenza followed by bronchial pneumonia. He was very ill, but I did hope he would pull through but he suddenly changed, and passed away quite quickly. I was with him at the time he died, I can only assure you he died peacefully and quietly. While conscious I told him I was going to write to you and asked him if he had any message, he said he sends his love and regretted he did not feel well enough to write. The short time he was with me he was an excellent patient and I am very sorry his life could not be spared. I have gathered his personal belongings together and you will be receiving them shortly. </p>
<p>Please accept my sincere sympathies.</p>

		<p>My dear Neita</p>
	</div><!-- end class='letter_header'-->
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Have been trying to write to you for several days, but have felt so depressed. You will all be wondering and waiting for a reply to your cable. Cannot yet  realise that Don -your darling Don at &ldquo;Rest&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thought perhaps there might have been mistake but now I have heard from the Chaplain I feel it must be right and no more letters have come for me and I know he would have written. I am sure you will like to have his last letter. I wonder if he meant me to cable to you, but I really thought he would soon be feeling better and I knew perfectly well he would hate you, or his people to worry over him. He has been in hospital several times before and out again long before you had heard. How heartbroken you and his mother must be. We one and all feel it sadly here, in fact I have been unable to collect my thoughts to write to you, but I feel it must be for the best, dear.</p>
<p>Do you know that many of our gallant boys who have fought for &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; they now are dying with influenza. It seems so dreadful when we all want to rejoice and be thankful that those dear ones are called away.
News are still away to the little village of Ypres of boys who have fought so well have died this week in France.</p>
<p>I am wondering if Don wrote to you. He might have been able to write in his diary perhaps or got the nurse to. The nurse has not replied yet but I am enclosing the letter from the Chaplain. I have written for a photograph of the grave and given George full particulars too, also his friend because Rouen is not far and they might find out more. George&hellip;&hellip;. I cannot get in touch with him and I am sure he would answer. I rather favour he may have gone on leave and letter is still waiting for him. I dare not send off the cable and say he is well before I hear from him. I am glad the other cable returned to me, otherwise it would have been terrible for you. Don wrote a week before he had influenza, I believe I sent you out the letter. He was the very best one to write, always knew where to find him   &mdash;just a few lines but it was enough to satisfy one.</p>
<p>Your cable arrived which quite startled me although every post we were looking for a letter from Don. He has been the very best in writing letters, just little slips like the enclosed one, but one felt relieved.
I still think there ought to have been someone at the hospital to write or send back my letters and parcels because my address was on the outside&mdash;but  one cannot imagine the rush there in all these hospitals, with hundreds ill, even the nurses and doctors have died.
Such awful accounts have come through and we know a little distress in the village of ours. The men here have been frightfully ill and many girls have died. It's just like a hurricane. A soldier on leave brought it to the place. It seems the Best and Purist have sacrificed their lives or are marred for life and many others who have caused endless trouble return home safe and sound from France.This is how it happens in this place.</p>
<p>Well darling, you must think and be thankful that your dear boy helped to save the world from destruction because that would have been the end had the Germans won.</p>
<p>Don worked hard at the signalling and had done excellent things. I am sure he was a perfect example to his friends. God's ways are higher than ours. Think how lovely those boys have met -Frank he was so fond of and always praised him and Sid he loved and told me many things of him which were all to his credit. Everything seems so muddling as if things had come to a dead stop. My heart aches for you and you all. How I longed for all the boys to return to you. Feel my work has been all in vain. Still the boys have sealed our living and England is once more &ldquo;Free&rdquo;.
We shall never forget what they have done. The Australians came at once to the call. How well you have kept Don posted, with snaps which he loved. Poor darling Neville. I told Don he ought to return home at once, he needed a father to whip him. I have said many things which I ought not to have said but I am sure he understood me.</p>
<p>Have been to London to see Bernie off, if only he was safely across should feel so happy. I wished I could have done more for your dear Don, he was so truly thankful for the least little thing.</p>
<p>My love to you and to you all</p>
<p>Nellie</p>

<p>Your birthday cable arrived a week before. I also sent that out to him. How he loved your letters. You kept him posted with full details and he loved the photos of yourself and baby. My prayers are for you and I feel just awful as if I had lost my darling brother.</p>

<p>We are all feeling for you and little Mac. Words cannot express our sorrow. It's too awful, but darling you must think that God  needed him, a good, nice honourable man. Rejoice to think you bore his name. He adored you, and it's really wonderful the love he had for you, even to the last two days before he died he didn't wish to worry you.</p>
<p>You have his darling son left to comfort you. How lovingly he thought of him, it was a comfort to him. HIs plans had always been that he would return home to you but now he&rsquo;s gone to a Heavenly home and I am sure his Spirit will for ever hover over you. </p>
<p>He was a darling. So very straight. His letters always so nice. Sent out his last one written on 20th October, saying he had the flu but too weak to write, really was afraid it would frighten Neita, and would I write to you for him, which I did. Received it on the 23rd, so he was already dead before it reached me. However I didn't know this, so sent off a parcel at once with things for an invalid; grapes, new butter, sweets and about eight other things and wrote several letters but received no answer. </p>
<p>As he told me he was getting on fairly well I thought perhaps he had come out well at last. I felt too anxious and sent out again to the 3rd Stationery Hospital France. No answer. I felt the people might have sent me word as I put my address on everything. The Cable reached me early in the morning, 9:15, it was a shock. Oh how we shall miss him. </p>
<p>Bells are ringing with joy but the whole day I have wept  it's too awful just at the last day to hear the news. I care not now if we have peace or not, there's so many dear boys who will not return, but they have saved our homes and England for which we can never repay that love. Sent out to G.K.F at once when I had Don&rsquo;s letter and told him the hospital, thought perhaps he might be near and could enquire. G.K.F was okay last week, I pray that he may come home to you.</p>
<p>Cheer up darling, Don would love you to keep well.</p>
<p>Bernie on final leave, next boat returning home.</p>
<p>My love to you, will find out full particulars and send them.</p>

He was delirious and unconscious most of the time but the end was peaceful and quiet. He is buried in the English cemetery he in Rouen.

			<h1 id="australian_camps" class="chapter">Australian Army Camps in Britain</h1>
				<!--h2>Australian Camps in England</h2-->

<p>The following camps were used by the AIF during the Great War. Some of the camps remain to this day and are now home to Infantry and Artillery Units of the British Army, whereas many were closed and demolished soon after the end of the war. Although practically all signs of the WW1 camps have now gone, the presence of Australians during the war is very apparent, particularly when visiting the local and military churchyards in the surrounding area, where many succumbed to their wounds or died from illness particularly the flu epidemic of 1919. Australian soldiers also left their mark on the hillsides at Codford and Fovant with ‘Rising Sun’ cap badges cut into the chalk hills.</p>
<h3>Bulford</h3>
<p>Bulford camp was one of the original camps built on the chalky Salisbury Plain having been purchased by the army in 1897, its location ideal for training the Cavalry and Yeomanry. The original hutted camp was built in 1900 on the site of the present Sling Barracks. In 1916, an annexe to the Camp called Sling camp was occupied by New Zealand forces, then comprising four main sections: Auckland, Wellington, Otago, and Canterbury Lines. It was officially called the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade Reserve Camp, and trained reinforcements and casualties who were regaining fitness. A hospital was established at the army base, as a specialist venereal disease hospital. It was handed over to Australians in November 1916 and was known as 1st Australian Dermatological Hospital.</p>
<h3>Codford</h3>

<p>With its easy rail and road access to Warminster and Salisbury Codford made an attractive location for garrisoning troops. During the First World War, there were fifteen different camps built in and around Codford, at first to accommodate British troops before their deployment to France, but in July 1916 Codford became a New Zealand Command Depot for men who, as with the AIF system, were convalescing from wounds or sickness. The Australian No.4 Command Depot moved to Codford from Wareham in Dorset in June 1917 until November of that year when it then moved to Hurdcott.</p>
<p>The camp is no longer there but one of the most notable features illustrating the presence of Australian soldiers is found on a nearby hill outside Codford, where a ‘Rising Sun’ cap badge measuring some 175ft by 150ft high, has been cut into the chalk. Also an Anzac cemetery (photograph) is located in the village close to the church and contains the graves of thirty-one Australian and sixty-six New Zealander soldiers.</p>
<p>To learn about the Australians that are lying in Codford Anzac Cemetery, visit the WW1 Australian Soldiers & Nurses who rest in the United Kingdom project website.</p>

<h3>Fargo</h3>

<p>Fargo was a Military Hospital that was also used for prisoners of war. It is likely that most of the 141 Australians and thirteen Americans buried in Durrington Cemetery would have been patients at Fargo. Included within the Durrington Cemetery is 6177 Pte HC Canham of the 22nd Battalion who died of pneumonia in January 1917. Also in the cemetery is a monument dedicated the men of the 1st Training Battalion (photograph right) that died and were located at the nearby Lark Hill training camp.
To learn about the Australians that are lying in Durrington Cemetery, visit the WW1 Australian Soldiers & Nurses who rest in the United Kingdom project website.</p>

<h3>Fovant</h3>
<p>The Fovant military railway was built in 1915 from Dinton station enabling a series of camps to be built stretching from Compton Chamberlayne to Barford St Martin, and included the Hurdcott Camp. Australians were prominent at Fovant from August 1916, becoming the major occupants in March 1917. At the end of the war Fovant became a major demobilisation centre handling thousands of British soldiers a day.</p>

<p>In 1924 a cross was erected in Fovant churchyard(photograph left) in memory of the forty-three Australian and twenty British soldiers buried there after dying in Fovant Military Hospital. An impressive reminder to the presence of troops in this area can be found on a nearby hill, where the ‘Rising Sun’ cap badge can be seen along with seven other regiments insignia carved into the chalk, known as the Fovant Badges (photograph below).
To learn about the Australians that are lying in Fovant Curchyard, visit the WW1 Australian Soldiers & Nurses who rest in the United Kingdom project website</p>
<p>Heytesbury</p>
<p>Knook Camp, Heytesbury was an Artillery training base on the edge of Salisbury plain, with Heytesbury House used as the officers’ quarters. From 1916 Australians occupied the camp. Heytesbury House was the home of Siegfried Sassoon, the first world war poet, from the 1930s until his death in 1967, aged 80.</p>

<h3>Hurdcott</h3>

<p>The camp located at Compton Chamberlayne and close to Fovant (and the Fovant badges, pictured right) became known as Hurdcott Camp as it was on land that was part of two farms, one of which bore that name. Australian battalions moved to Hurdcott in 1916, and in March 1917 Hurdcott House became the headquarters of No.3 Command Depot for the AIF. At the camp practice trenches were dug, together with a bayonet fighting assault course close to a bombing ground, and five huts were transformed into a camp hospital. In November 1917 No.4 Command Depot moved from Codford to Hurdcott. By January 1919 the command depots had all but ceased to function in their primary use and were now receiving men from France on their way back home.</p>

<h3>Lark Hill</h3>

<p>A tented camp was first established in 1899 specifically set aside for artillery practice. In 1914, the first permanent huts were built and during the First World War, 34 battalion sized hutted garrisons were built for use by all different types of military forces. By mid-1916, Australian troops were the major occupants of the camp. A light military railway line was built from the established Amesbury–Bulford line, to carry troops to Lark Hill and on to an aerodrome at Stonehenge. The wartime hutments at Lark Hill Camp extended dangerously close to the World Heritage archaeological site at Stonehenge, which also included ancient burial mounds or ‘barrows’ in the vicinity which were vulnerable to being dug into.</p>
<p>After the war, the garrison became an artillery domain and in 1919 the Royal School of Artillery was established there.  Today it is now one of the main garrisons on Salisbury Plain, along with Tidworth, Bulford Camp and Warminster.</p>

<h3>Park House</h3>
<p>Park House, situated close to Tidworth, became a depot for the AIF, housing training battalions as well as engineers and signallers, its Army Service Corps and Army Medical Corps.</p>

<h3>Perham Down</h3>

<p>Conveniently situated a mile from Ludgershall station, Perham Down was initially used at the outbreak of war by some of the new Kitchener battalions. In 1916 Australia’s No.1 Command Depot was established at Perham Down, accommodating 4,000 men, until it moved to Sutton Veny in October 1917. The Australian Overseas Training Brigade, designed to toughen up convalescent men prior to being sent back to the front and for combat was established at Perham Down from June to October 1917, when it was transferred to Sand Hill (Longbridge Deverill).</p>

<p>Unlike many camps built in Wiltshire during the war, Perham Down continued with many of the wooden huts being replaced by brick buildings and is now one of the major garrisons on the Salisbury Plain. Ludgershall station, once a key transport hub for arriving and departing troops has now gone, but the railway line remains (photograph showing where the station was located, with the platform having been on the right).</p>

<h3>Rollestone</h3>

<p>The camp, close to Fargo and Lark Hill, was taken over in 1916 by Australian training battalions, and it was here that the reinforcements destined for the AIF 2nd Division and hence 22nd Battalion were trained. With limited huts, some of the men lived in tents during the summer.</p>
 
<h3>Sutton Veny</h3>

<p>Sutton Veny’s proximity to the Warminster-Salisbury railway line made it an ideal choice for an Army camp when the Great War started, and the camp had its own railway with a connection at Heytesbury Station. Australian No.1 Command Depot moved to Sutton Veny in October 1917 from Perham Down. Prisoners of War were also detained here and a hutted hospital opened in 1916, providing beds for 11 officers and 1,261 soldiers.</p>

<p>In January 1919 staff of the 1st Australian General Hospitaltransferred to Sutton Veny from France, and at this time many patients were suffering from the Spanish influenza epidemic. At the end of 1919 other Australian depots in England were closing with Sutton Veny becoming the final assembling base for Australians from France, where they had mostly engaged in reburial work. Once all the troops had departed most of the huts were removed and the camp railway lifted. Given that 1st AGH had relocated to Sutton Veny, a large number of Australians are buried in the local churchyard (photograph), many of the 143 having died from the flu shortly before returning home. Included within those that died are 61868 Pte DC Higgins and 3904 Pte J Podmore of the 22nd Battalion.</p>

<p>Every year since the end of the war the village of Sutton Veny remembers its Australian visitors, with the annual Anzac Day service at the church attended by the Australian High Commission, and the village children laying flowers at each of the soldier’s graves.</p>

<h3>Tidworth</h3>

<p>Tidworth became the headquarters for the Australian Imperial Force in the UK from mid-1916, being close to the numerous Wiltshire camps where the Australians where based during the war. For most of 1919, HQ staff at Tidworth were busy in the repatriation of Australian troops, with at any one time up to 40,000 men in these Wiltshire camps. Tidworth Military Cemetery (photograph) contains 423 graves from the Great War period – 100 were from New Zealand and 159 Australians, many of whom died in the influenza epidemic during the winter of 1918-19. To learn about the Australians that are lying in Sutton Veny, visit the WW1 Australian Soldiers & Nurses who rest in the United Kingdom project website.</p>

<h3>Wareham</h3>

<p>Situated at Worgret Hill near Wareham, the Dorset camp became in October 1916 the AIF No.4 Command Depot to receive the overflow from other AIF depots, caused by the influx from the fighting on the Somme. The Wareham Town Museum has produced two information panels (Wareham Camp & Wareham Town) that provides an insight into the camp, entertainment and life in general in the town during the Great War. As with the other Australian depots it was a camp for men likely to be fit in three months to resume active service. Sadly this would not be the case for thirteen Australians whose final resting place is in the churchyard of Lady St. Mary Church in Wareham. To learn about the Australians that are lying in Wareham, visit the WW1 Australian Soldiers & Nurses who rest in the United Kingdom project website.

<p>After the war the camp was relocated to Bovington, which is now a base to tank regiments and training within the British Army. Bovington is also now home to the Tank Musuem and with 300 vehicles stretching back to WW1 is regarded as the best in the World

<h3>Weymouth</h3>

<p>The Dorset seaside town of Weymouth has had a long military connection, with the Portland Naval base and Napoleonic forts within is vicinity. In May 1915, with a question over how to manage the Australian Gallipoli wounded once discharged from English hospitals, Monte Video House on the outskirts of Weymouth was chosen with its relaxing seaside location as a place they could report to and convalesce. The depot was the joint Australian and New Zealand depot until the NZ depot opened at Hornchurch in Essex in April 1916, with Weymouth becoming the AIF No.2 Command Depot. A second camp was opened at nearby Westham where soldiers that were deemed no longer fit for active service and waiting for repatriation to Australia were accommodated. Most of the Australians repatriated as a result of wounds or sickness passed through Weymouth – it is estimated that during the years 1915-1919 over 120,000 Australian and New Zealand troops passed through the seaside town. It is also recorded that there were over 50 marriages in 
Chickerell parish church between Anzac soldiers and mainly local girls, with many of the brides being taken back to Australia on repatriation.</p>
<p>
An important aspect of the camp was the re-training for the men that would be returning home, allowing soldiers to pick a completely different job for when they went home, including professions such as architecture, motor engineering, electrical and carpentry classes. For some of the men, the injuries sustained meant that they would not be able to return to their previous professions – note that labourers, industry and primary production requiring physical activity were the main professions for soldiers within the AIF – so this training was very important for them. Entertainment was also very important to keep the troops motivated and in high spirits whilst they were injured or ill, with touring acting and music companies regularly visiting the town and the camps, including at the YMCA building in Westham.</p>

<p>In the town today the Anzac Memorial on Weymouth seafront (pictured above) commemorates the Australian and New Zealand troops who were accommodated in the three camps in the town (Monte Video, Westham and Littlemoor) during WW1. In Weymouth and Melcombe Regis Cemetery (pictured above), close to the site of the Westham camp, there are eighty-six graves of Anzacs who were never to return home. Also in memory of the troops that passed through Weymouth there are a number of roads in a housing estate built on the former site of the Westham Camp that are named after Australian cities and states (example in photograph). Residents of these houses are still digging up remains of the camp such as bullets and cooking equipment to this day. More information including photographs, stories and maps showing the locations of the camps can be found in the Weymouth Anzacs web project.

<p>Did this appear in the Maitland Mercury</p>

<blockquote><p>Mrs McDonald of Charles Street West Maitland was advised last evening of the death of her husband Donald Cameron McDonald, who died from bronchial pneumonia on October 22. He sailed  for the front on November 9th 1916 and was serving with the field artillery. He was previously wounded in France. Prior to enlisting he had been employed for a number of years as accountant to a Newcastle wholesale house. Gunner McDonald was well known in Maitland and was very popular with all his acquaintances. He was the elder son of Mr E J Mc Donald of West Maitland and his brother Keith is serving in France as a driver with the Motor Transport. He leaves one young son and much sympathy will also be expressed with Mrs McDonald who has had one brother Sergeant Frank Fry killed in action. Her other brother George is still serving in France.</p>

Miss Neita Fry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Methodist Church of West Maitland was charmingly decorated for the marriage of Donald McDonald elder son of Mr and Mrs EJ McDonald* of “Glenorchy,” West Maitland, and Neita the only daughter of Mr and Mrs Richard Fry of “Wadhurst” West Maitland. The Rev W Henry Howard officiated. The bride who was given away by her father wore a charming bridal gown of white crepe de chene

and satin with fur and pearl embroideries. The court train was lined with ruchings of fresh pink ninon and trimmed with bonito lace. Her long tulle veil was worn cap fashion with sprays of orange blossoms. She carried  a sheaf of lilies and hyacinths which with a diamond ring was the gift of the bridegroom. In attendance as bridesmaids were Miss Violet Sawyer, (friend of the bride) and Miss Eily Fry.</p>

<p>Mr Keith McDonald acted as best man and  Sergeant George Fry as groomsmen. As the bride entered the church the choir sang “The Voice that Breathed o’er Eden” and during the signing of the register they again sang “O Perfect Love.” As the bridal party left the church Miss Manall (friend of the bride) played Mendelssohn’s “Wedding March.” Following the ceremony a reception was held by Mr and Mrs Fry at their home. Later Mr and Mrs DC McDonald left for Jenolan Caves, the bride wearing a saxe blue
