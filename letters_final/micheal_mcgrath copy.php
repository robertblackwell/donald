# ANOTHER MAN'S WAR

<p>Recently I had the priviledge to read a diary and some 75 year old letters from a soldier from the First World War
commencing with his departure from Sydney in November 1916 on S. S. Benalla. These letters were mainly to his young pregnant wife of only a few months and embody the highs and lows of this young man with his lofty expectations of a great adventure and travel and finishes in the filth, degredation, and misery of the trenches in Octaber 1918.</p>

<p>I suppose if placed in similar circumstances as this man was most young me would surely seize an opportunity to travel 
and taste adventure.</p>

<p>These notes in diary form and occassionally with extracts from letters redord the events and at times his thoughts and yearnings
for those two years. Because of censorship requirements he was unable and did not indicate precisely where some of these 
military actions took place but most were on the Somme where geat battles took place over the war years.</p>

Left camp for London at 6:30 a.m. and arrived London 12 noon. Saw all the sights and will tell you all about it in a letter. But wherever I went there was another bit of history I had read about.

12/2/17

Back in camp. There are a great number of German Prisoners of War near by. Received news that the bottle I threw over outside Melbourne has been picked up and was referred to in the Sydney "Sun" on 11/12/16.

Lots of mail. 15 letters. Wonderful. So glad my darling is well. Expecting about 27th June.

Great sensation at 5 p.m. 400 men required immediately for something unusual. I was selected. Only the tallest men. Marched to Amesbury. Train to South Hampton. Then to Bournemouth West at 11 p.m.


</td>
<td>
24/2/17
</td>
<td>
 

Breakfast. Marched up and down the town then back to camp and eventually to Amesbury. This was a show of force to a strike and riot of soldiers at Warcham Camp 15 miles from Bournemouth. It must have worked because it was all very quiet after we arrived.


</td>
<td>
27/2/17
</td>
<td>
 

Camp routine. Fatigues. We are numbers now not men or even animals. Food poor. Officers the worst lot. Papers are full of two British victories. Is this the big offensive we have been expecting. Hope so. The sooner the better and we can go home.


</td>

2/3/17
</td>
<td>
 

All units on strike on account of kit inspection at of all times 11 o'clock at night. The men were furious and with good reason. WE march and march all day. Do constant fatigues and then when we expect to get some sleep they put this on. The CO saw reason. Some officer was full of his own importance won't occur again. We hope.

5/3/17

Visited flying school nearby. 31 machiines. I think they are French "Farnums". Cousin Sid hopes to take course. Has appplied. They need small men so he should fit that requirement.

20/3/17

Food scarce. Allowance of bread only 4 small slices a day. No butter. Sometimes dripping. Good news from France. Germans on the run.


</td>
<td>
25/3/17
</td>
<td>
 

Not a particle of food wasted. Left overs made up into hash or pudding. Am told inedible food is used in the making of munitions. A lot of my mates are in France now. Will also go soon. Am not looking forward to it so much now. I have seen so many wounded hereabouts in hospitals and in London. It seemed every second man in uniform in London was ccarrying an injury. Men I have spoken to who have been in the tenches say it is just murder.

LETTER:-"Must not forget to tell you about Boulogne and the "Bullring". Whilst we were at Boulonge the town was out of bounds. But being so that is probably the reason a bunch of us decided to see the town. Had a good look. The French very happy to see us. Hard to walk through on the cobbled streets especially as we were carrying full pack and rifle. Didn't see an MP at any time. 

Now for the "Bullring". This was where we were tortured by a pack of British and Australian drill instructors. They did let up day and night for 17 days. Day and night they marched us or ran us and we undergo awful exercises with full battle kit up to knees in mud and slush. They were a sadistic lot and we hated everyone of them. We are told that a previous draft go so mad they put one instructor in hospital. There was a hell of a to-do. Anyway we had to do all this on bully and biscuit. We are starving. There is averse doing the rounds that goes like this:-

	"Somewhere in France soldiers are seen
	Walking about all very lean 
	Walking about with bowed down head 
	Praying to god they will be fed.

	Somewhere in France in mud and rain 
	Soldiers are saying 'never again'
	Never again in one deep breath
	will they come to France and starve to death "

Well we finally survived the running and marching and then odd hun aeropplane which came over and dropped a bomb on the parade ground which did no explode."

Camp routine. Letter from Nellie informing me that brother in-law Frank and my wife's dear brother has been killed in action. She will be heart broken and the family will take this very hard.

On leave. Left hospital. Train to Goudhurst. Met by cousin Nellie at station. It is wonderful to be in a home again and to receive such loving care from someone whom I have known about and corresponded with but never met. Cool fresh sheets. Clean clothes and where she gets the food from I do not know but it is wonderful. Must write home and tell Neita how well I am being cared for. She may stop worrying for a while.

LETTER:-(To an old friend back home) This break has given me time to think and to realize how fortunate I have been so far. I haven't really seen that much of the trenches as compared with others but I cannot forget the mud, the filth, the dead mates, the lice and the fear - constant all the time and of course the relief when the hun lets up. He suffers the same of course because we are giving him a real belting. the sooner this is over the better for us all. We have been taught to kill and we do it so thoroughly.

Whilst I am staying here with Nellie I must write you in more detail about various things .... must tell you I had a letter from your brother George. He seems to be having a good time with the girls or so I presume. The letter was signed George and there were kisses, rows of them, around the edge of the paper. I guess he got mixed up with whom he was writtiing to.. A mate of mine tells me that George was as "happy as larry" the night before he left for France. Can't blame him.

We heard today that 4th and 5th Divisions are being disbanded and will be used to reenforce 2nd and 3rd. There should never have been these two divisions as there would always be insufficient reenforcements. Papers are raving about break-through of Hindenburg Line.

Great trip to Scotland. Beleive George and Sid had a wild time in London. Girls galore. Can just imagine how they would go through London. IN a letter from his mother (George) I was asked to tell George that there were many better girls in Australia. Little notice he would take of that.

LETTER:-"Fritz has been over London a good bit lately. Everyone greatly excited. No dount you have read a good deal about the strikes in Germany. Hope they are true.

LETTER:-"Yesterday we had a big muster for the ppurpose of finding who were all these spare men the units had. A couple of hundred were caught who had attached themselves unofficially to some staff companys. Simply did nothing but walk around or played cards or boozed up. Did they get a rocket. I am known as 'Old King Coal' as I am in charge of the fires. Can eat at the Officers' Mess. Good tucker. Things are very quiet at the front. The papers are saying that Fritz will not be ready for a big push for another fortnight. What do you think of the Russians. Never did put much fait in them. I am still hanging on by the skin of my teath. Hundreds from here have gone over to France so my time will come. Both sides seem to be waiting for the other to start something."

This is a poem that is going the rounds:-

	"My Tuesdays are meatless
	My Wednesdays are wheatless
	I am getting more eatless each day.

	My home it is heatless
	My bed it is sheetless
	They're all sent to the YMCA

	The bar rooms are treatless
	My coffee is sweetless
	Each day I get poorer and wiser.

	My stockings are feetless
	My trousers are seatless
	My how I do hate the Kaiser."

LETTER:-"Heytesbury Camp. Note my new addrress. My good time has gone at last. On Monday came word to Sandhill Camp that every artillery man had to go on the draft immediately. Now the trouble was caused by an artillery man who was put on guard duty against the usual rules. The fool wrote to General Birdwood direct and complained. Well within minutes the word had come through that the whole lot of us were on the draft. Leave cancelled etc. There was a hell of a stir. There is no way to express the fury of the men particularly towards the fool who wrote the letter. I tried to get out of it but no luck. A definite order from the General. So I am off to France. Am not looking forward to it but I know more about what to expect."

Back on the Somme and in reserve. Living in an old farm house. WE are however close to the front. Heavy firing. Many casualties passing to the rear. They all look so wretched. 

NOTE:

Unfortunately there are no further diary entries as most of the pages after the above havebeen removed. THere are also no more letters to his young wife and one can only conclude he was unable to write or they have been lost over the years. From the many he wrote it is most unlikey that he would stop writting unless force to by circumstances. There are however a few letters several to a friend in Maitland and several to cousin Nellie.

LETTER:-"Dear Fred. Have been attached to this battery for two months now and have had three weeks in the line, then out, then back in again, and now in reserve and can write a few lines. We have been given a bad time. The hun will not give up even though we have given him more than he has given us. It is impossible to describe the constant shelling we have had. Shells falliing all around us. We did nothing for days on end but fire. Very little rest and hardly any sleep and then to be waken with alerts. Just heard we have to go up to the line again for another push. I sometimes wonder will I ever escape to a rational world again. I despair don't let Neita see this."

LETTER:-"Dear Fred. We are near Amiens. I cannot describe how we are suffering and certainly cannot write Neita along these lines. Have had a touch of gas, eyes and chest, but only a few days off and now while there is a lull I can write to you. I am definitly not well but then many others are worse and we are still coonsidered ablebodied. It is beyond words to describe the constant shelling and all we do is dig and dig and as one shelter is destroyed we dig another. Then we have the constant movement of the guns as they get stuck in the mud, we use the horses that are left and of course push and shove ourselves. The horses are exhausted and frequently if not hit by shrapnel will just fall down and die. Their terror is awfull. They stop, bolt around crazed. It is hell on earth. The dug outs are frequentl half full of water and whilst in the line it is impossible to change clothes and for days on end we are soaked and covered with mud and have to sleep like that as well. From my dugout on this lovely clear day with hardly a cloud in the sky I can see several dead horses that helped pull our gun carriage. They are covered by rats eating the flesh and surrounded by millions of flies. they will just be left there to rot. the stench is nearly unbearable. There are several of our boys lying out there as well that have died during the day. We cannot go out and get them until it is dark. For what it is worth we have advanced about 5 miles and many prisoners are being walked to the rear. They all look shatttered and defeated I guess we must look like them as well for we are a dispirited lot. Still we are advancing so lets hope something will come of it."

LETTER:-"Dear Nellie. Am in No 2 Stationary Hospital France. Have a case of Trench Fever. Brought on by the infernal lice and have a bad cough as well. Have to have something done to my earlier wounds as they are infected. The hospital is like a hell on earth with many men dying each day and others moaning or screaming or crying. Others just look blankly at you. Some blinded others shell shocked. I have lost so many of my good mates. Please write to Neita I am unable to do so at present. Tell her I will get home yet and see that son of mine and we shall have such a wonderful time."

LETTER:-"Dear Nellie. Have the 'flu' but getting better I think. Have been here 4 days. Can't remeber if I have written to you for some time and am sorry I haven't. I can't remember. Will you please write to Neita. If she saw a letter like this she would go silly. No hope of "Blighty". Your loving cousin Don"

LETTER:="From Rev. H. W. Mackay, 3rd Stationary Hospital Rouen. I find in our records that 30280 gunner D.C. McDonald was admitted here suffering I presume from the prevailing Influenza and Pneumonia epidemic and died 10 minutes past 9 on the morning October 22nd. The epidemic was at its worst at the time. I assume if he were able to write to you on the 20th his case took a sudden turn for the worse. He was buried in the British Section of the Rouen Cemetery on October 24th with military honours."

Eighteen days later on November 11th 1918 an armistice was signed by the Germans."

# What is it that we know about this man 

We know that he was born on November 4th 1888 in Maitland NSW. His father was born in Australia of Scotish parents and his mother was of Welsh extraction. He attended maitland Boys High School and progressed from there to an accountant's position with a large Neewcastle wholesale firm.

He was a tall outgoing man, six feet in height, and he described himself in one of his letters as being 12 stone 3 pounds "those rounded shoulders have gone and I am as tough as a tack".

From his letters home we consider him to be somewhat conservative in outlook yet prepared like most Australians to buck authority on occassion which he did at times with great delight.

He was beyond doubt a gentle man and with all the hopes and fears that beset men who are called on to leave their loved ones and face an uncertain future.

His letters refer longingly to the times in the future when he and his wife and son would be together again. He long to see and cradle his son but this was not to be and one can only share his anquish late in October 1918 so near to the conclusion of the war, when it no doubt dawned on him that all his hopes and asperations of a joyful reunion and a long happy life would be forever denied him.

It is a sad story, but of course, only ne of many more.

Some five miles or so on the outskirts of the French City of Rouen is the Imperial War Graves Cemetery of St Sever where the bodies of so many British and Commonwealth soldiers lie.

Above the grave of one such soldier stands a grave stonbe which reads :

	30280 DRIVER 
	D.C. McDonald
	Aust. Field Artillery
	22nd October 1918
	Age 28 
	He sleeps. Then God smiled
	and it was morning matchless
	and supreme

This man was my great grandfather.
