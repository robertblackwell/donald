<p>Our division is still out resting and the boys are having a grand time. The weather is very hot so therefore indulge twice a day in a good swim. This life would do us for the duration of the war. Last Monday I was transferred from the DAC the 15th Battery AFA AIF France. That is my new address. Have not heard from Nellie Fry lately. It won&rsquo;t be long now that I'll receive your letters re-addressed by her. Every time I change my address I notify Nellie straight away. I am on the battery staff of the 15th battery. Well kiddie had a grand time last Thursday. Leave for the day. Left camp about 7.30 am and walked to a station about one and a half miles distant where I caught the train arriving at about 9:45 AM. The fare was very reasonable 5p second class single. Had a good look around the city, viewed the magnificent cathedral etc.. What we wanted more than anything was food and by jove we got it. Made beasts of ourselves. Fruit, cherries, strawberries, ice cream, oh don't mention it. Just grand to get into civilization again. Of course everything is very expensive 20 francs a pay (14/8) does not go to far. But all the same I've got a few francs left. After a glorious day caught the train at 8 PM and reached camp about 10 o'clock. During the day I met several chaps  I knew, one being Bert Wall who once lived in Maitland. He is the son of old Wall who was once an auctioneer. I bought a few postcards which sweetheart I'll send along in due course. Will try and get another day off next week. Well dear the time is drawing near when the long looked for cable will be due. You mentioned in your letter to expect the greatest event about the 24th, that is tomorrow week, every day after that sweetheart I will be waiting and expecting the great news every minute. Darling I will keep all I've got to say and how I feel until I get the news then kiddie. I will give full vent to my feelings.</p>

<p>Going to censorship it is very hard to write for nothing concerning military is allowed to be written. If it were allowed I could write scores of pages and very good news at that. The mail has just come in and as usual yours truly got a skinner one of the boys received 39 letters.</p>
<p>Will now ring off, kiddie and make way for a wash and swim. Au revoir to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband with tons and tons of kisses.</p>
<p>Don</p>
