<p>How are my two darlings getting on, sincerely hope okay. I&rsquo;m just &lsquo;it&rsquo; and going strong. Kiddie for the last couple of months I've not been putting stamps on your envelopes, let me know if you get them alright.  There is no reason why you should not receive them. Have never missed writing, every week in fact, there have been weeks when I've written three or four times. Last Monday had a letter from Annie Roberts, wishes to be remembered to all at home. Also receive two from Keith, has not yet got his leave. He had a grand time at Christmas and the New Year. The poor kid is suffering from chilblains on the feet, said he had no idea chilblains could be so bad. I wrote to Sid asking him about the &pound;2, received a reply from him yesterday enclosing the two notes. He has forwarded Georges &pound;5 to Nellie. Darling I had a real good day yesterday, received five of your loving letters, one from dear &lsquo;bubs&rsquo; just lovely, one each from Jean and May Goodsir. The numbers of the letters sweetheart are 104, 108, 109, 110, 111 and 112. So poor &lsquo;Bubs&rsquo; is starting to suffer from his teeth, look after him kiddie. Yes sweetheart I received your and Bubs kisses on 4 November. Remember quite well a funny feeling on my lips that day. There's a lot of talk about the Australians being relieved by the Americans and transferring to Mesopotamia and Egypt. It's only a rumour, but it is welcomed by the boys. You are rough sport saying Bubs has a large mouth like his dad. That beats the band, like his mother, for you had a beauty, eh what. You cannot tell me too much about Bubs, dear, the more the better, my love one. The cake with &lsquo;love from Wadhurst&rsquo; has not yet arrived, will be welcome when it does, I can assure you. Anxiously waiting for Bubs parcel. Pleased to hear you got a post card album, when I return and looking over them will be able to tell you some good tales, the truth, I assure you. Guess you'll be some class at the wedding, wish I were with you sweetheart. Wait till we have our second honeymoon, kiddie. The postcards are just the thing, very good indeed. But wait till I get home, you'll get a &lsquo;bosca&rsquo; smack on the&hellip;&hellip;? lips of course and on the &hellip;.. also. Bubs writing takes the bun, no wonder he yelled when doing it. Fancy taking a photo of Bubs sitting on the jerry. That's the time he should have kicked up a noise. All the same, I'd like to have seen the little darling. The photos enclosed are glorious, how I wish I could be nursing him. Suppose my turn will come, eh sweetheart sooner the better for me. The one taken with Vi  Is very good, both are in a happy mood. They are all very good of Bubs, but one of you kiddie, you seem to be in a very bad mood. I should be there to fix you up. The second one of you is undoubtedly good. Wish I were nursing the two of you right now. Well darling I'll now ring off. Supper is just about ready. Grilled steak tonight.</p>
