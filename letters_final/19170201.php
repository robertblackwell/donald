<p>Camp life is just the same all fatigues. For the present I am a bit better off, being in the signal school. The weather is still bitterly cold, ice everywhere, a great number of the water pipes have burst. Had snow today, you can imagine my dear marching out through the snow to do the signal work, we thoroughly enjoyed it. The days are getting longer which is just what we want. </p>
<p>Had a letter from Lieut. Col. Beardsmore the other day, nothing very much in it, but said he had received a letter from his wife saying that I was here and also that Keith would be arriving shortly. He wants me to call and see him as soon as I arrive in France. Tonight I received a letter from my cousin or auntie (don&rsquo;t know the relationship for certain) Annie E Roberts. She gave me a surprise it was news, it was this, that Keith was in France. Cannot make it out. This is what she said &ldquo;I heard Keith is in France and had met Eric Roberts one of my brothers boys etc, There is a bit more about Keith when over here meeting her two brothers. The two brothers have since died. Her brother Tom and family now live in London. &#8232;Keith also met them so she wants me to call and see them. It is a fairly long letter the main point is asking me to be sure and spend my leave with her at her home at Bournemouth. As for  leave I don't think there is much chance of getting it but if we do where am I going to spend it? Have five places to stay and they are all very particular that I must go to their homes and spend my whole time with them. Not going to worry for the present. Will decide when we get the leave if ever we do.Going to write tomorrow to Annie  Roberts and ask her if she has Keith&rsquo;s  address. Fancy hearing about him from her. </p>
<p>About cooking fish why dear you make my mouth water would give all I have to be with you cooking fish, as you say darling wait until we go to the Hawkesbury, then you will have to cook for three dear.  Had a great feeling today that I would like to be taking a trip to the caves like we did last year darling, how about you dear when I get back we&rsquo;ll make the pace. This is letter number 8 that I received last night. Keep your writing up darling it is simply grand to get letters from my dear little wife, makes one feel that I'm not so very far away from home and wife. </p>
<p>As to the name of our heir to be well the boys name is okay in fact so is the girls. You asked my opinion dear well as for Novak it is not bad, did not think that name was a favorite of yours but I could  not suggest another. Girls names strange to me now, this life makes it hard to think there are girls. Novak is alright sweetheart but if I think of another I like better I&rsquo;ll tell you in a following letter. But dear wife you forget you only mentioned names of one boy and one girl, what if it's twins two boys or two girls, got you now, in case the most likely happens, I am sure it will, think of some more names dear.  What a youngster, the best ever, could not be otherwise. Round about 27th June will be dates for me to look forward to. What say you sweetheart. </p>
<p>Well dear wife I&rsquo;ll now ring off there is no more news will write again before the next mail closes which is on 5th February. Going to make a piece of toast and then go to bed. Au revoir to my darling wife with love and embraces from your own loving husband. </p>
<p>Tons of kisses.</p>
<p>Don</p>
