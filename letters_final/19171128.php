<p>Monday was another good day for me, kiddie received a batch of 18 letters. From you dear I received six letters, 1 card, 1 from darling &ldquo;bubsie&rdquo;, Don 1 card, Grandma Fry 1 letter, Glen-Ayr Fry&rsquo;s  1 card, Auntie Jane  1 card, Flo Roberts  1 card, Vi  1 card, Phyll two letters, and grandma McDonald's two letters. Simply grand, just bosker receiving them, the Xmas cards were  indeed very good. The numbers of your letters sweetheart are; 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103. Well I told you in my last letter that I was pulled off draft at the last moment but did not state why. Now that I'm more settled will tell you why. </p>
<p>One day walking through the camp I met Bob Watson who is a regimental quartermaster. He said &ldquo;Mac&rsquo; do you want a job that will keep you in England for awhile, of course I said yes. After a terrible lot of bother and &ldquo;pulling of strings&rdquo; I've got a job in charge of the camp coal yards. This position should not be held by myself, on account of me being fit.  A number of men (unfit) were sent here yesterday, to take over the positions held by fit men. Well one of these men is to relieve me, but Bob Watson has got a lot of say with the result this man is to assist  me. Artillery men are also supposed not to have jobs, only infantry, so I'm having a hard fight for it. Anyhow it may only last a few days or it may last months. If I do get kicked out Bob said he thinks he can fix me up with another job. Let's hope so anyhow, eh kiddie. It's a good stunt nothing to do.</p>
<p>I'm practically John Browns representative in Sand Hill Camp.  Kiddie, do not hold out to much hope for my remaining in Blighty although my prospects at present are very bright. It's all due to Bob who has done his darndest for me. Of course if I hold it, it is sure to cost me a few bob so don't be surprised if I send for money. If all turns out well &ldquo;Watts&rdquo; and myself are going to have a small room for our sleeping quarters. He undoubtedly has a lot of influence here and I understand it was he that got George his job. I'm in with the sergeant majors now so therefore I require a few more shillings, it's alright, may keep me in England, for the winter at the least. I'm considering you and bubs kiddie, and I bet you will say quite right and be jolly pleased.
So you two dears  were  in Armidale and appear to be having an enjoyable time, very pleased indeed to hear, wish I could have been with you. Tonight I met Jeff Huysone. Had a good talk over old times. He is expecting to go to France shortly, but hopes to be able to &ldquo;swing it&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Have you won the car yet Kiddie, do me, talk about a trip to the caves, don't mention it. Very pleased to see that Neville is getting his own way regarding getting up in the morning, I would not mind sitting up all night with the little dear, eh what, what do I hear you saying love. Will be looking for the cake Millie made, would come in very handy at present dear. I'm feeling hungry will have to get some supper.</p>
<p>By jove kiddie the sugar tablets will be just the thing when they come. Sugar is very scarce, never have it in our tea. All the parcels that the boys receive contained sugar of some sort. We had some of the tablets in France, bought them off Americans, went okay. George told me yesterday that Fred Street has been killed, do not know for certain whether it is correct. Going off now to get supper, kiddie, I'm just about starving, may have more news in my next letter regarding my job. Hope to be able to say that I&rsquo;ve settled down for the duration. Weather lately has been cold but no snow up to date. There's another draft leaving here on Friday I'm pulled off again. Our battery over in France is out on the line and not going in again until February. Love and kisses galore to my dear sweetheart and darling son with kisses and hugs from your ever own and loving husband and father. </p>
