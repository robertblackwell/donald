<p>Yesterday I received your most welcomed letter, Number five. Have only received three so far, so therefore two are missing. They must be the first two letters sincerely hope they come along. It was grand receiving your letter dear it put new life into me absolutely. Some of the boys in my hut received10 to 20 letters, lucky dogs. I also received a letter from mum, she mentioned sending a Maitland Mercury along, have not received it yet waiting anxiously for same it will be grand to see the old rag. One of the boys received 2 Sydney Heralds I perused them to see if they contained any Maitland news, but disappointed. Anyhow I read  of Brigadere General Patons wounds. Was speaking to his brother today, he told me that the General was conducting a charge when something went wrong, then the general got out of the trench, next thing a sniper got him through the arm and body, it was serious, but he is doing well now.</p>
<p>The weather is still very cold, ice everywhere all  one feels fit for is bed. Have got chillblanes on the feet very badly, cannot walk about in comfort very disagreeable. I would give anything to have some New South Wales weather no matter how hot. All the boys are getting thin yours truly also. The meals we get would not satisfy a cat. Three meals put together  would not make one decent meal. Buy our tea now and again, but we cannot flash off every night of the week. Food is getting very expensive. Last Saturday morning we were inspected by Gen. Brunker, a tame sort of an affair.</p>
<p>Walking up to our hut after the inspection I noticed a lady standing nearby, who should it be but Mrs. Crowley. Of course there was great rejoicing especially by Mr. Crowley. She did not have a good time coming over, they were chased on four occasions by submarines, also they picked up two boat loads of passengers from other boats which had been damaged. Mrs. Crowley looked very washed out and much thinner. She is staying at Amesbury 4 miles from here so therefore her hubby can see her every day from five till eight o'clock. He is going to get a bike. Oh what a lucky dog. Sincerely wish you were closer dear it would be just great. 
Mr. Crowley said after what he has seen on this side he would not allow his wife to take on nursing.</p>
<p>Well you picked up a horse shoe for luck well I did the same. When in Cape Town I picked up a shoe and was looking at it when an old man said &ldquo;take that with you Laddie for luck&rdquo;, well dear I still have it. The two ought to bring luck oh kiddie. As for Vera Solling would not put it past her clearly she has not forgotten Dick.</p>
<p>Well darling there is absolutely no news in the rotten camp. Wish the darn war was over would catch the first boat home without seeing much of England. No place like dear old Maitland. I am like yourself darling always thinking and planning for he or she. Won&rsquo;t it be lovely when I'll be able to embrace you both. Keep your pecker up dearest. Will now close sweetheart look after yourself and don't worry.</p>
<p>Tons of love and kisses to my darling wife from your loving husband.</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>Keep the writing up I look forward to your letters everyday.</p>
