<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Just received something great two letters from you dear dated 15th and 22nd of November. It was simply great. I was feeling very down but they have braced  me up and I feel like a cat with a little live bird.</p>
<p>Keep your writing up, well dearest it is the only thing I look for. This is only going to be a very short letter dear, they is no news but I thought I would write straight away and let you know I received some letters.  Have just been inoculated and going to get paid shortly. The mud is awful, clean boots and leggings are out of the question.</p>
<p>Very pleased to hear that you are all keeping in good health. I am continually thinking of you dear,  and little &ldquo;Mac&rdquo;. Keep your pecker up dear.  Have just been paid and received the large sum of one pound two shillings, that's a total of 3 pound two shillings for the trip. </p>
<p>Our quota is all split up, scattered all over the camp. Was just speaking to Crowley his wife does not arrive until tomorrow the 14th. The  boat is a week overdue. He told me he is not going to allow her to go nursing after seeing how things are over here. They will only see one another for about three days while he is in England, this camp is a real gaol. </p>
<p>I noticed on the envelope you addressed dear, that the number was placed up In the corner, put the number in the corner also above the name. </p>
<p>Au revoir my dear wife for the present, love to my darling with love, kisses and embraces from your loving husband.</p>
<p>Don</p>
