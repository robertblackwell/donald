<p>Suppose you received my last letter stating that I was about to leave Hurdcott. Left on Saturday morning 10 o'clock, marched to Wilton almost 4 miles, there caught a train, and arrived at  Warminster at 2:30 PM. Another 3 1/2 miles march to our present camp which is very close to Sutton Veny. Settled in about 4:30 and after tea went to the pictures. This is a very poor camp, the boys are simply disgusted with it, and are offering to go straight away to France. Food is very poor and very little of it. If it does not improve there&rsquo;s sure to be trouble. On Sunday morning while having breakfast who should I see sitting at another table but Eric Hewitt, of course dear you can well imagine our feelings on meeting again in Blighty. Have been constantly together ever since. Also met a number of the Bonalla boys. Sunday afternoon another chap and myself went to the village of Heytesbury to meet a lad who we had knocked about together with. He lives in Heytesbury and we spent the afternoon and night there sitting around the fire smoking, just the thing. Tea again in a private home was grand. We'll be leaving here about Friday for our artillery camp at Heytesbury. While in the village on Sunday met one of the the Benelong boys he expects to be leaving for France in about a fortnights time.</p>
<p>(Re the postcard) These badges are worked on a chalk hill the property of The Earl of Pembroke at Hurdcott straight opposite our hut. The lodge is where we went to buy apples 20 for a penny, good ones too. In the left-hand corner can be seen a small structure, well it&rsquo;s a train car, converted into a refreshment room, here every day we had tea coffee and biscuits.</p>
<p>How are you getting on dearest and how is our bonny son, sincerely hope and trust you are keeping in best of health. I'm okay. Love and kisses to my dear sweetheart and darling son from your ever own and loving husband and father.</p>
