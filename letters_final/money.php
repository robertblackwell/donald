<p>At the time of the Great War Britain and Australia used a system of currency called <span>pounds, shillings and pence</span>, £sd </p>

<p>Indeed up until 1910 Australia had used British notes and coins for its currency. Thereafter Australia introduced its own
bank notes and coins but that currency system was still based on £sd <span>pounds shillings and pence</span></p>

<p>The £sd system was a pre-decimal system in which:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>a pound was equal to 20 shillings</p></li>
	<li><p>a shillings was  equal to 12 pennies</p></li>
	<li><p>a penny was equal to 2 half-pennies or 4 farthings</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not surprisingly a notational system was developed for expressing, in shorthand form, monetary amounts.</p>

<p>So for example, a sum of 1 pound, 2 shillings and 3 pennies was written as :</p>
<pre>
	1/2/3
</pre>

<p>If the sum being expressed was, say 2 shillings and 3 pennies (that is no pounds) that sum would be written as:</p>
<pre>
	2/3
</pre>
<p>And would be said as "2 and thrupence". The case of 6 pence was special and a sum such as 2/6 would be said as "two and six".</p>

<p>A sum consisting of just pounds, without shillings or pennies, for example 13 pounds was write as :</p>
<pre>
	£13
</pre>

<p>A sum consisting of only shillings, say 3 shillings, was written as :</p>
<pre>
	3/-
</pre>
<p>The "-" symbol denoting "none".</p>

<p>A sum consisting only of pennies, 5 pennies, was written as:</p>
<pre>
	5p
</pre>
<p>and was said as "5 pence", not 5 pennies.</p>
