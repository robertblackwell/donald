<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Back again in France, after a glorious time in Blighty. I have not joined the units yet. They are now moving up and expect I will meet them tomorrow. If I had been allowed to come back the way I desired I would have been with them now. </p>
<p>My intentions were good when in England that was towards the letter writing. I expected to write quite a number, the time was or appeared to be awfully short and I was dreadfully busy. Expect Don has told you that I went to Warminster, spent the night with him, also that we made arrangements to go to Scotland together. We decided to go up on Friday night. Well I met all trains leaving for Scotland but unfortunately did not see Don.. As I did not see him I did not feel like going up that night, so decided to go up to Scotland the following day, Saturday. Saturday came, but I did not get out I had a ton of luck that day. One never knows his luck in a big city.</p>
<p>Being anxious to go to Scotland I persuaded myself that whatever happened to go on Sunday morning. I got away early on Sunday morning, at about 11 o'clock found the Scotland train but got fed up of train travelling and broke the journey at Newcastle. I spent a couple of days in Newcastle, then went on to Edinburgh and then to Glasgow. At Glasgow I had a horribly decent time and left there on Thursday night (after doing a theatre) for London. I might have stayed longer in Glasgow but had to fulfill arrangements in London. I arrived in London at 8 o'clock o'clock Friday morning and as it was the last day of my leave I had a hundred and one things to do.</p>
<p>On Friday night had a look at The Maid of the Mountains at Daly&rsquo;s Theatre an, awfully jolly thing then ended a perfect day at 3 AM Saturday morning. As the train left for France at 6 AM I had only a few hours sleep and believe me it was not half hard having to leave.</p>

<p>All I am looking forward to now is another Blighty but suppose it will be some look.</p>
<p>Received a letter from you when in England, also the photo of the nipper. I had been dwelling on a photo for sometime.
I have a few more letters dragging which need a reply so I must now conclude this note.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately</p>
<p>Keith</p>
