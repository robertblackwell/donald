<p>Received your very welcomed letter dated 11th of November about a fortnight ago. I'm still going strong in this camp although things are very unsettled this week. Hundreds have been warned for draft. We are only supposed to remain here three weeks, then overseas, but of course these orders can be twisted when one is in the know. Anyhow my time for leaving may come any day. </p>
<p>Keith is in England at present on 14 days leave. We have been together for a few hours. I've just returned from a week trip to Edinburgh. Keith was to have come with me but somehow he was nowhere to be seen when the train was due to leave. </p>
<p>Scotland is a great place and needless to say I had the time of my life. Visited all places of interest including Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, St Giles&rsquo; Cathedral, Forth Bridge etc etc. Went to Leith and saw a naval ship building yard. The trip up the Firth of Forth was very fine. Also had a day and night in London. Looking forward to my next leave, Scotland will do me. </p>
<p>Love to all. Hope all are okay. Love to Neita and Bubs.</p>
<p>Your sincere son-in-law Don</p>
