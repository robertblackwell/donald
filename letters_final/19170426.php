<p>On Saturday Jim, Ken and I went to Salisbury and met Bob Kerr and also Don, as arranged. After tea we all went to a theater and spent a few miserable hours. On Sunday I went for a decent little trip to Bournemouth which is 45 miles from camp. The car we arranged to get broke down, we managed to get another and a lady driver, of course we were awfully annoyed. As we six had some knowledge of cars, the girl handed the whole business over to us. She was a good judge too, for we only had three punctures going to Bornemouth. We left camp at 11 AM and drew up at the Pier Hotel Bournemouth at 2 o'clock for dinner. We flew around the city for a few hours see all that was worth seeing. We left at 11 PM and arrived in camp at the respectable hour of 2.00 AM. The  girl had to go to Andover, another 10 miles. By the time she arrived at her destination it was hardly worth while going to bed. How would that stunt suit you and especially driving Australians as all letters from Australia contain complaints about the hot weather and the daylight saving scheme. Our case is just the reverse. Glorious weather and the daylight saving idea suits us nicely.</p>

<p>Will now wind up or I shall be telling you some news.</p>
