<p>In my last letter I mentioned having received your loving letter number 41. It was simply grand to receive your letter after such a long spell without news. Now that the mail has started to arrive I should get my share. Sincerely hope you received the letter containing particulars of Frank. There is absolutely no news to write about. We are still camped in that position where we joined our division. The huts  we occupy are called the &ldquo;dog leg&rdquo; huts, rather a flash name eh what. Weather is grand, just like our Australian weather, at times it is very hot but the nights are generally cool. The days are very long, daylight from 3:30AM to 10PM. Can easily read the paper at 10 o'clock at night. Very pleased kiddie to know that you are receiving my letters okay. Sincerely hope you receive the album of photos. It was registered so should reach you safely. There is no chance of getting photos here. But where it is possible I get postcards of the country through which we have passed. Received a letter from Keith the other day. He is having a grand time, plays football instead of drill, but like all good things he says it gets tiresome, now he wants to move to another camp. Will be anxiously looking out for your parcel sweetheart, anything in the eatable line is more than welcome. Yes the national party had a great win, the boys on this side voted the right way. Fancy the mata<span class='fn'>Don's mother</span> canvassing for votes. She is getting younger every day, the giddy old sport. She was well rewarded for her work. </p>
<p>It was amusing being called a nice girl, but it's a fact, you were always and will be a nice and good girl eh dear. Well how is little Mac getting on, suppose by the time you receive this  letter, he will be a fair scamp giving you any amount off work, keeping you awake at night, kicking up a terrible row. What would I give darling to be with you now and for the next couple of weeks. But such cannot be the case, but you can bet your sweet life yours truly will get home as soon as possible to my dear wife and little one. The mail has just come in, but none for yours truly. Couple of the boys had received parcels. What I'm looking and waiting for is the cable five suppose I'll have to wait until the end of the month. Today we received our weekly issue of tobacco. The cigarettes I gave to one of the boys, I do not smoke cigarettes, the tobacco was bad so had to throw it away anyhow I got some Captain from one of the boys. The pipe keeps me company it's a good friend out in these parts. Our suppers are still going strong. Hard times. they call it. This is what we generally have for supper, cocoa and currant cake with about half ian inch of strawberry jam on it. Does not go too bad.</p>
<p>Well darling will now say au revoir with scores and scores of kisses to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband.</p>
