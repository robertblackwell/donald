<h3>The Village Blacksmith</h3>
<h4>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h4>
<p>
Under a spreading chestnut-tree<br>
The village smithy stands;<br>
<br>
The smith, a mighty man is he, <br>
With large and sinewy hands;<br>
And the muscles of his brawny arms 
Are strong as iron bands.<br>

<br>His hair is crisp, and black, and long, <br>
His face is like the tan;<br>
His brow is wet with honest sweat, <br>
He earns whate'er he can,<br>
And looks the whole world in the face, <br>
For he owes not any man.<br>

<br>
Week in, week out, from morn till night, <br>
You can hear his bellows blow;<br>
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge, <br>
With measured beat and slow,<br>
Like a sexton ringing the village bell, <br>
When the evening sun is low.<br>

<br>
And children coming home from school 
Look in at the open door;<br>
They love to see the flaming forge,<br>
And hear the bellows roar,<br>
And catch the burning sparks that fly Like chaff from a threshing-floor.<br>

<br>
He goes on Sunday to the church, <br>
And sits among his boys;<br>
He hears the parson pray and preach, <br>
He hears his daughter's voice, Singing in the village choir,<br>
And it makes his heart rejoice.<br>

<br>
It sounds to him like her mother's voice, <br>
Singing in Paradise!<br>
He needs must think of her once more, <br>
How in the grave she lies;<br>
And with his haul, rough hand he wipes <br>

<br>
A tear out of his eyes. <br>
Toiling,--rejoicing,--sorrowing, <br>
Onward through life he goes;<br>
Each morning sees some task begin, <br>
Each evening sees it close<br>
Something attempted, something done, <br>
Has earned a night's repose.<br>

<br>Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend, <br>
For the lesson thou hast taught!<br>
Thus at the flaming forge of life<br>
Our fortunes must be wrought;<br>
Thus on its sounding anvil shaped<br> 
Each burning deed and thought.<br>
</p>
