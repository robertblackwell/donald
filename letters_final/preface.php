<p>This book seeks to preserve, and make accessible, the letters that Donald Cameron McDonald wrote to his new young wife Neita  Somerville Mc Donald (nee Fry) during the period 1916 to 1918, and to tell the story of Donald's experience and death in the Great War.</p>

<p>I am Nina Marguerite Blackwell (nee McDonald), the compiler of this book, and the eldest of three daughters of Neville Frank Cameron McDonald the only child of Donald and Neita Mc Donald.</p>

<p>For all of my life I knew that my grandfather had died in World War 1 and that my paternal grand mother had raised her only child (my father) by herself. But as I grew up that story was history and like children and young adults everywhere my focus was on my own life and looking forward.</p>

<p>As each of the grand daughters have aged and decided to downsize their homes Donald's letters, cards and other documents from the war years have been moved several times. On the occasion of the last move the three grand daughters decided that all three should examine all documents remaining from our grandparents and parents.</p>

<p>Examination of Donald's correspondence revealed that the documents, mostly written in ink but some in pencil, would not last much longer. Many were after all over 100 years old, and others nearly so. As the eldest granddaughter I took on the task of 
digitalizing them, before they were lost forever.</p> 

<p>That turned out to be a sizeable task for I quickly realized that I wanted to make these documents into some form of book and that for such a purpose simply scanning the originals as a digital image would not be sufficient. Thus I set about the arduous task of reading all the documents into a speech recognition program in order to get actual text documents.
This highly error prone task required many hours of proof reading and corrections in addition to the initial reading aloud of all the documents. I also scanned all documents as a backup and as the only way to preserve images such as the photos on the face of postcards.</p>

<p>At the end of this process I had the right raw material from which to start the process of making this book. However the process was not perfect. Don’s writing was very neat and legible, but age had made the documents difficult to read. I have done my best to record exactly what he wrote with the help of others’ eyes and magnifying glasses but sometimes a turn of phrase or word has eluded me. Where places were mentioned but spelling difficult to decipher I have checked the validity where possible.</p>

<p>On occasion only one of a set of  postcards exists but I have included them where I feel they fit into the story. Many many letters and postcards have been lost over time especially those covering the period following the birth of his son and the months prior to his death but I am sure they did exist at one time for he was a frequent writer and devoted husband.</p>

<p>In addition, Don's documents are from the society of 100 years ago so language usage has changed as well as many other things, things that Don and Neita took in their stride but that may seem strange to younger generations. I have tried to overcome
these issues with footnotes and appendices to explain; expressions, word usage, places, contemporary historical events
and even contemporary money.</p>

<p>The documents are personal communications in a family context and as a consequence many people are mentioned only by their first name. Presumably Donald and Neita knew well who they were talking about and such people were probably family or acquaintances. Neither my sisters or I, nor older members of the family still living,  could work out who all of them were. Thus to help readers from younger generations or non family members we have identified below the commonly mentioned characters (that we can identify).</p>

<ul>
<li>Keith was Don's brother who served in, and survived, World War I,</li>
<li>Frank was Neita’s eldest brother who served in but did not survive World War I,</li>
<li>George was Neita's younger brother who served in and survived World War I. Chas and Don were Neita’s youngest brothers, 
neither were old enough to serve.</li>
<li>Vi was a freind of Neita's, and Franks fiancé at the time of the World War I.</li>
<li>Nelly Fry was Neita’s cousin living in England</li>
<li>Phyl, or Phylis, is mentioned many times, I feel she must have been a sister, cousin or close friend of Don's but to date no one
has been able to shed any light on her relationship to Don.</li> 
</ul>

<p>I should also note that date format and spelling follows the Australian and British practice. So for example dates are day-month-year and the word colour, for example, is spelt with a "u".</p>

<p>Nearly 25 years ago the eldest great grandson of Donald and Neita,  Michael McGrath, examined these documents closely as part of a high school assignment and wrote a timeline summary of the story. He had access to Donald's diary for the years 1916-1918 as well as letters Donald wrote to friends; sources which are no longer available;
but which add to the understanding of Donald's war experience. Michael's assignment is included as an appendix.</p>

<p>What we three grandchildren have missed by not knowing our grandfather we will never know but by reading these letters and visiting his resting place in Rouen France we have come closer to knowing this wonderful man.</p>
