<p>Here is a postcard which might interest you. Wet and cold today, ice an inch thick, had to be broken before having a wash. Snowing again yesterday. Mud right up to our knees. Went to the pictures last night, don't think I'll go again for a long time. Prices are <?php render_pence(4);?>, 7p and 1/2p.</p>
<p>Have just written to Mr. Paton and Bearsoth.</p>
<p>No more letters to hand yet. Suppose Keith is over here by this, would like to know where he is, for his sake I hope he does not come to this camp, I don't think he will. Did a 9 mile march yesterday morning, very tired after it.
Crowley just came in and told me he just received a wire from his wife. She is safe and sound, arrived last night.Oh darling if only I could get a wire saying you were here. Suppose I will have to wait until I return. </p>
<p>Love and kisses my darling wife from your loving husband.</p>
<p>Don</p>
