<p>Just after getting to bed last night I received your most loving and welcomed letter No 20.
2 and 4 are still missing I think they must have gone astray.</p>
<p>My thoughts were exactly the same as yours dear, the day I arrived. While on the water it did not seem that we were too far away but as soon as we landed there was a different tale to tell, seemed as if there were worlds between us. Anyhow we were thankful to arrive okay, found out later that during the last two days of the journey, two submarines had been sunk very close to our course. Regarding the cable, no doubt it caused you some amusement but I addressed it such:-Mrs. D McDonald  &#8453; McDonald's auctioneer etc. You say you will have to wait another six weeks for more of my letters, no this will not be the case as I posted a very large mail at Cape Town. As to camp life there is nothing to tell, only that our food supply is to be cut down again and after the 15th the YMCA and Salvation Army will not be allowed to sell anything to the soldiers which contains sugar in the making. Don't know how we are going to get on then, it's bad enough now goodness only knows.</p>
<p>This afternoon I visited camp number 11 and met a number of Maitland boys; Tom Sawyer who was okay, Len Hann, you remember this lad, George brought him to Charles Street several times, Ross Johnson of Lorn, looking well, Russell Brown, Harley Ekford and Ted Spinney. There were a number of other Maitland boys in camp but did not have time to look them up. Fancy Tom and Harley Eckford saw me at Dakar, also Ross Johnson, they called out to me but failed to make themselves heard. Of course they  came along on the same convoy. They told me that George was okay while in camp and the night of his departure for France he was as happy as Larry. You may know this, if not it will certainly interest you, Russell Brown told me the boat he and George came over on, owing to the rough weather on the last few days of the journey lost trace of their escort, so therefore they were at the mercy of the submarines. Well one day one officer fell overboard and the boat stopped to pick him up. While this was going on, another boat just ahead of them was sent to the bottom. To all the boys, they consider the rough weather saved them without doubt.</p>
<p>Did not see Ken Spinney. He was very ill coming over but pulled through okay under the care of Dr Major Pintand an old Maitland doctor. </p>
