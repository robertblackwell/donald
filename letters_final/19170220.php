<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Just received three of your most welcomed and loving letters, numbers 9, 10 and 11. Keep your writing up, it is the greatest pleasure for me to receive my dear wife's letters. Every night I look out for your letters. When the n.c.o. brings the mail around at night and calls out my name, to see me, you would think I was a youngster, what ever I am doing stops indefinitely. As for the photos they are great, what would I give to have been sitting next to you dear on the step, of course you understand my feelings. You seem to be in a jolly good mood, so to the rest. The house I know well, Vi and Elma look okay, but you kiddie, it brings back happy memories. Lucky people to be able to go in for a swim. No place here for swimming and the water we have is all frozen. Anyhow when I get back we two will have a great time at the Hawkesbury or somewhere else giving  little Mac a paddle. You speak of writing miserable letters, not at all Kiddie. It's always best to write what one thinks, than to write a lot of bosh. Anyhow your letters always put me in the highest joy. I got those few tears as kisses darling. You say try and get back by next June, would that I could love, for the greatest event in history, but bet your life I'll get back as soon as possible.. As for the war when we arrived it looked as if six months would do it but from news we receive straight from the front, things are not so bright and today's papers seem so too. Have spoken to a number of officers from France, they all say in their opinion that victory will come at the latter or beginning of next year, but as to what happens before, well you can imagine. </p>

<p>Your going to start and make shirts, that's grand but don't forget and make too few for there is a chance of twins&hellip;&hellip; what do I hear you say. Give us a kiss kiddie.</p>

<p>Very pleased indeed to hear that the holiday did you good, and that you are a good deal fatter, suppose you are fatter in more ways than one, now don't go off kiddie, I know you would not. </p>

<p>Had two letters from Phyll the other day, also received a pair of socks from her. Had another letter from Mrs. S Smith in which she enclosed several sprigs of flowers, of which I'm enclosing one to you. But this is not all on Sunday, I received a parcel from England, who should it be from but her ladyship Mrs. S Smith. Contained date scones, sausage and cheese rolls. Words fail me, how pleased I was, sat down and had a feed, and then dropped her a letter straight away. It was simply grand of her don't you think darling. Here is some news for you I don't think I told you about it before. At 2 pm on November 11th, 1916 while off the Victorian coast I wrote a note and got the signatures of a number of men nearby, nobody in particular, put it into a bottle and threw it overboard. I asked the finder to send it to the &ldquo;Sydney Sun.&rdquo; Before I go any further while on the boat made friends with a married man D McCall of whom I&rsquo;ve told you. Well he got a letter from his wife the other day stating that she had the note and bottle. It was picked up at Port Philip and forwarded to the &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; and appeared in the issue 11th December 1916. Mrs. McCall saw it and being the first to call at the office took possession of it. Her husband's signature was also on it. He and I are still great friends always go about together. In her letter she asked her hubby if you kiddie had a prior right to it, if so would send it to you, but at the same time did not want to part with it. Anyhow I understand her hubby has written her telling her to send it to you but whether you are to keep it I cannot say, that rests between your two selves. But fancy it getting into her hands, we feel very pleased indeed to think that it was picked up. </p>

<p>Met Arley Eckford on Sunday. He is okay. Did not see Tom Sawyer, he was away at church, good boy. At my first opportunity I am  going up to their camp. Today I was inoculated. Last Sunday spent a good whole day at Amesbury. It's a fine little town, had meals at the George Hotel and by jove we made things look scarce. Their prices are high 2/6 and 3/-. The place of greatest interest is Amesbury Abbey dates back to the year 1426 rather old. This church and Abbey was founded by the ancient family of Antrobus<span class='fn'>Antrobus&nbsp;is a name of&nbsp;ancient&nbsp;Norman origin. It arrived in England with the Norman Conquest of 1066. The&nbsp;Antrobus family&nbsp;lived in Cheshire, where they held land.</span>.
This family is now wiped out, the last two male members being killed in the present war. Very interesting old place. Could write pages about it. One thing might interest you. A number of ancient Queens were buried in vaults under the church and Cromwell dug up the remains and secured the lead from the coffins to make bullets. Years after, they were re-buried, of course  we had to inspect every part and can assure you we did it properly. Kiddie the books I am sending you are nothing new, but when I return and in my spare time looking through then will be able to explain many interesting things. </p>
<div class='closing'>
<p>Well darling will now close hoping you are keeping the best of health. Remember me to all friends. Love to all at Charles Street also mum and dad. Please give them any news in my letters. Love and 000<span class='fn'>a 0 symbilizes hugs in the same way that an X or X symbolizes a kiss</span> embraces to my darling wife from your own loving and sincere husband.</p>

<p>With love and kisses xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
