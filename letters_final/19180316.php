<p>Since writing your last letter which was Thursday, I've received your everloving letter number 132, which contained the photos of Bubs and Doris Fry,  also three parcles, one from your dear self containing socks, handkerchiefs, biscuits, milk, ginger etc etc tin of peaches. Thanks to your mum and again thanks to your dad. A cake each from Auntie Jane and Auntie Von. They were both in first-class condition, the icing on Auntie Fons being only cracked slightly, the wording &ldquo;Greetings from Auntie Fon&rdquo; was as good as the day it was put on. Tell you the cakes soon found a dark passage down our necks. The photo of dear Bubs and Doris is just bonza simply lovely. What a darling kid. Why can't I get home. Have the photo in front of me at present, wish I had Bubs sitting on the table in front of me. Very pleased to hear that  Bubs can say &lsquo;mama&rsquo;, suppose in your next letter you'll be advising me that he can swear. The army is the place to be educated on the art of swearing. Of course sweetheart don't for a moment think I do, why your hubby could not do such thing. </p>

<p>So Vera Roulston is going to take up house keeping, good luck to them, lucky beggars.&rdquo;Babe&rdquo; Nicholson is to be married, how many more Maitlanders are there going off, strikes me it is a wise policy for our boys to marry over this side for I'm afraid there will be no single girls left when they return. You say things are very dear, you ought to be over this side. Food particularly is very scarce. When the boys go on leave they have to take their rations with them such as sugar, tea, butter and meat. It's almost impossible to get anything otherwise.</p>

<p>Well darling I'm off to France again next week, unless pulled off by the dentist. Do not think this is likely as I&rsquo;ve only a small job to be done. Have sent two parcels containing clothes to Nellie, also sending another today, including my watch which has the screw which turns the hands broken. It's practically useless taking it overseas.</p>

<p>Bernie is getting on well, down with Nelly this week. No news of George or Keith lately. Darling it is just about tea time so I'll ring off, will write again tomorrow. Of course there's no news to tell but as long as it's a letter, eh sweetheart. Look after Bubs and don't you smack him or when I get home, look out, you'll get a few smacks on the &hellip;.. and the lips to be sure, eh darling.
Love kisses and embraces to my darling wife and precious son, from your ever own and loving husband and father with oceans of love and kisses galore.</p>
