<p>spare time<span class='fn'>There seems to be one of more missing postcards of which this one is a companion. This one was included
despite the lack of the others because its face photo is of the Australian Hospital Harefield.</span>. You don't mind for once do you darling. Received Neville's photos. They are not too good as far as photos are concerned, but of his lordship, well they are simply lovely send along some more wifey dear. Nellie Fry is a great girl
and she treated me as if we had known each other for years. Did not like leaving, will tell you everything in detail in my first letter. Have a lot of post cards which I'll send you. Hope you'll like some.</p>
<p>All the news till later</p>
<p>By jove our darling ...</p>
