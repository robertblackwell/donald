<p>Well we're now settled down in our new camp. Its only 10 minutes walk from our old camp, but it's further away from the main road and YMCA and Salvation huts etc. We were originally in Number 21 camp attached to Number 1 unit but now we are in Number 26 camp attached to Number 5 unit. The new conditions are very much better taking everything into consideration. The meals are very much better, if they continue so, under the war conditions, we won't grumble, but of course we do not get enough to satisfy. Every night, in fact several times during the day we visit the canteens where two hard boiled eggs, two slices of bread and a cup of tea can be had for 7p. To night another batch of our boys left for France. Walked a short distance along the road with them, said goodbye and a handshake with every one of the November Quota boys. There are very few of us left now. Have absolutely no idea when we are likely to go, not for some time yet at any rate. There are a number of our boys trying to get away, they make an application, but are always turned down. It's no use applying, the soldier is only known by his number. He is sent away when the authorities feel fit and no sooner. There are a number of men in this camp who have been here close on 12 months and have repeatedly made application to get away but no and have no hope at present of getting away. Now we are in a school, away from all other men there is a greater chance of getting weekend leave. If it comes off, I'll be off as often as I can, then I'll be sending for money. The leave is from Saturday midday to Sunday midnight. I'm getting on the rocks, but have enough for the first weekend. Wrote to Keith on Monday, also again tonight. The English newspapers are full of war. At present everybody is waiting for the next move, the result, there seems very little doubt.</p>

<p>Well darling suppose you are working like a house on fire making clothes for our Mac. By jove darling I wish I were with you now, it would be simply great but suppose I'll have to be contented and wait. They say time flies but its too slow for me at present, anyhow kiddie I'll get back to you and our baby as soon as I possibly can. But sweetheart teach &ldquo;ours&rdquo; good manners, so that I won't have to walk the floor too much.</p>

<p>Au revoir darling, going to turn in now. Wish I were going to bed with you love, but we&rsquo;ll make up for it, eh darling. Love and kisses to my darling wife from your loving and sincere, devoted husband with kisses and embraces.</p>

<p>Don</p>

<p>Take these darling XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and many many more love Don</p>
