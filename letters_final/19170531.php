<p>We are present in the position when the Germans and British started the great &ldquo;Somme&rdquo; battle last year. There are very few inhabitants about, soldiers billeted in a lot of the ruins. Last Monday at 8 AM we left out old camp, caught the train and after a journey through the beautiful scenery of France arrived at our first stop at 2:30 PM. Here we detrained and witnessed for the first time a ruined town caused by German shells, words fail to describe the damage done. Marched from the station to a rest camp about one mile distant, here tea was provided and after a rest we marched to our present position about 4 miles. As soon as we arrived we took up our positions in billets. These billets are old sheds, stables, and remnants of houses. I turned in to bed straight away. The bed consisted of wire stretched over two beams, but a good bed all the same. Soon got to sleep but found out that I was not all alone,  rats  &ldquo;oh what rats they were&rdquo; running all over me, jumping from the beams onto yours truly. While half asleep one ran across my face, but too tired to worry. When I woke in the morning discovered that the rats had eaten holes in my tucker bag and eaten a number of biscuits, of course I ate the rest, no matter how many mouths had been at them. Viewed the ruins during the morning, also the church, very fine indeed. At night I attended a concert given by&ldquo;The Anzac Coves&rdquo;, was not too bad at all. Wednesday morning had a look at the old trenches used by the British including the first dressing station used by the British in this sector. Then took a walk into this hut &ldquo;The Army Hut&rdquo; and who should I meet but Billy Foster of East Maitland. Spent the whole day together, giving one and other all the news. Had dinner together and went to the pictures that night. Bill is just back from leave in &ldquo;Blighty&rdquo;. Can assure you we thoroughly enjoyed one anothers company. We are both in the military and in the same division. I'm going to try and get in his battery. I was the first Maitlander he had seen for a very long time. While we were walking along the street we met a young chap, I know well from Farley by the name of Armstrong, of course you can well imagine how pleased we all were each of us wanted to know all the latest news of home and to be sure we each had some to give. This morning I met Bill again had a few hours together including a sing song in this hut. Bully beef and biscuits is all we have been able to get to eat but  for dinner today we made some stew and by jove it was grand, keeping some for tea. Have no idea how long we will be here, have not joined our division yet  BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB<span class='fn'>indicates text redacted by military censors</span>

<p>from here and when we do it's very likely to be   BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB*</p>

<p>Dearest I have not received a letter since arriving in France and goodness knows when I will get them now, soon as we settle down,  I will write to headquarters and give them my address. Kiddie I will write as often as possible but conditions here do not facilitate writing anyhow dear you can rest assure I will do my best.</p>

<p>This morning while I was away from my rat hole a young chap from East Maitland by the name of Everingham called to see me. There are several boys in their family so do not know for certain which one it was, no doubt he will call again. </p>
<div class='closing'>
<p>The weather here is grand, beautiful sunshine. This town we are in was the scene of very heavy fighting, this is clearly visible, after a walk around. It's only a matter of four months since the last shells landed in the place.</p>

<p>Well my dear there's very little to write about so will say au revoir for the present. How are you getting on, just okay I hope. Getting very anxious waiting for the cable, have not got to wait long now, eh kiddie. I'm okay, do not worry, there is absolutely no need for it.</p>

<p>Love you, kisses and embraces to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband with tons and tons of kisses.</p>
