<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>We are all feeling for you and little Mac. Words cannot express our sorrow. It's too awful, but darling you must think that God  needed him, a good, nice honourable man. Rejoice to think you bore his name. He adored you, and it's really wonderful the love he had for you, even to the last two days before he died he didn't wish to worry you.</p>
<p>You have his darling son left to comfort you. How lovingly he thought of him, it was a comfort to him. HIs plans had always been that he would return home to you but now he&rsquo;s gone to a Heavenly home and I am sure his Spirit will for ever hover over you. </p>
<p>He was a darling. So very straight. His letters always so nice. Sent out his last one written on 20th October, saying he had the flu but too weak to write, really was afraid it would frighten Neita, and would I write to you for him, which I did. Received it on the 23rd, so he was already dead before it reached me. However I didn't know this, so sent off a parcel at once with things for an invalid; grapes, new butter, sweets and about eight other things and wrote several letters but received no answer. </p>
<p>As he told me he was getting on fairly well I thought perhaps he had come out well at last. I felt too anxious and sent out again to the 3rd Stationery Hospital France. No answer. I felt the people might have sent me word as I put my address on everything. The Cable reached me early in the morning, 9:15, it was a shock. Oh how we shall miss him. </p>
<p>Bells are ringing with joy but the whole day I have wept  it's too awful just at the last day to hear the news. I care not now if we have peace or not, there's so many dear boys who will not return, but they have saved our homes and England for which we can never repay that love. Sent out to G.K.F at once when I had Don&rsquo;s letter and told him the hospital, thought perhaps he might be near and could enquire. G.K.F was okay last week, I pray that he may come home to you.</p>
<p>Cheer up darling, Don would love you to keep well.</p>
<p>Bernie on final leave, next boat returning home.</p>
<p>My love to you, will find out full particulars and send them.</p>
<p>Yours lovingly</p>
<p>Nellie Fry</p>
<p>I have Don&rsquo;s watch and diary.</p>
