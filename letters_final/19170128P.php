<p>Postcard &ldquo;under the spreading chestnut tree&rdquo; The Smithy at Figheldean, Salisbury Plain.</p>
<p>This is where I went yesterday afternoon and had a very good time. Five of us had photos taken under the tree. Will send you one kiddie as soon as I get them. The tree at present is bare not a leaf on it.</p>
<p>Love Don</p>
