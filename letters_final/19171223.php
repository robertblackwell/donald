<p>Well kiddie Christmas is round again and I'm still away from my loved ones. Never thought this time last year that I would be away for another Christmas. Never mind darling surely I'll be back for the next and what a great time we will have, more especially as we'll have Neville with us. </p>
<p>On Thursday I went into Warminster and sent you a cable, Christmas greetings etc. Hope you receive it on Christmas Day. Would be simply great if you did. On Friday I had a letter from Nellie, also a Christmas cake and pocket diary for 1918. Very good indeed of her. The diary was just what I needed. Fully intended buying one in Warminster yesterday, of course that saved me a few bob. Keeping the cake which is  boska for Christmas. Went into Warminster yesterday and bought a handkerchief which I'm sending to Nellie tonight. While there met George roaming around. He went on five days leave today, staying in Bexley Heath. Have not heard anything of Keith lately, don't think he can be over this side yet. I could have had this week off. Wrote to Nellie for the balance of my money 5/18, received it today. Going to wait until Keith comes over and then hope to spend a week with him. Will try Scotland. If this comes off will have to get the loan of a tenner from the &ldquo;Bank of Love Ltd&rdquo; Manager Nellie Fry. Nellie wants Keith and I to go down there, it's a good way away, anyhow I may go down later on. Have not decided where I'll go this week, maybe Bath. </p>
<p>Wish you dear and bubs were here, would not want to go anywhere, would we darling. Just dig in somewhere, some quiet spot and have a jolly good time. And what a time we would have, to be sure, eh sweetheart.</p>
<p>Sid I understand is going to Goudhurst for Christmas, &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; Nellie thinks so, but Goudhurst is far too slow for Sid, don't blame him either. Have been very busy lately working all days and every night. Have not been to the pictures once this week, that's a record for me in this camp. Our suppers are still going strong. Tonight's menu, grilled steak, bread and butter, toasting cheese. Tell you dear, it goes well. But having it just before going to bed gives  one a nightmare. Last night every one of us had some tall dreams. Mine was good was back in Australia, with you darling, bubs was there but quite different to what I'll expect to find him when I land home once again. You and I were making the pace kiddie, eh what. Nuff said.</p>
<p>Snow has been on the ground for over a week now, not very deep but it's bitterly cold. Today has been the mildest day of the week, sun is shining and a beautiful moon tonight. Good night for a raid. No doubt Fritz will make the most of it. </p>
<div class='closing'>
<p>Au revoir for the present darling. Sincerely hope you'll have a very enjoyable Christmas. Wonder what you will put in bubs sock. Waiting until next Christmas. Supper is getting ready can smell the steak, it smells okay. What about having some with me darling. Could easily get some condensed milk for bubs. No need for that, mother could fix him up. What can I hear you saying, give me a smack where? On the lips to be sure!
Love kisses and embraces to my darling sweetheart wife and bonny son from your ever own hubby and father with oceans and oceans of kisses and love.</p>
<p>Your loving husband and daddy</p>
<p>Don</p>
