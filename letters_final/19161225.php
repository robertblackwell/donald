<p>A Merry Christmas and a bright and prosperous New Year to your dear self and all at home. A mail is leaving port today for Australia so we are given the opportunity of writing a few lines. This is Christmas morning all are in a happy mood but dear old home is on the mouth of everyone. Have called at four ports, the last we stayed five days and this is the fourth day of the present port. Will write a full letter in a day or so and post it at our destination. Was at communion at 6:30 this morning. I'm in the best of health feeling very fit. Remember me to all my friends. Love to all at home and a husbands love to my dear little girl and wife with kisses.</p>
<p>Don</p>
