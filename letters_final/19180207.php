<p>Joy in the camp on Tuesday, four of your loving letters arrived numbers 116, 117, 118 and 119. Also received letters from Daph, Vi, Phyll, and two from mum, so I&rsquo;ve got a few letters to answer. Working hard every day this week, at night always dog tired, does not take me long before turning into bed and sleep don't mention it. But bet your life there would be no sleep if you were with me darling would there? </p>
<p>Has been raining heavily the last few days but has cleared up tonight. Fancy that Mater spraining her ankle, trying to appear too young, it's no good, she's getting old now. &ldquo;Grandma&rdquo;.
She sure to go crook when you tell her what I've said. Why did you not win &ldquo;the nighty&rdquo; bet your life kiddie, no matter what it was made of, better if there was none at all, what can I hear you say not &lsquo;naughty&rdquo; but &ldquo;loving&rdquo;. What time we will have when we get together again, eh darling. Regarding my photo sweetheart Bubs owns it, learn and inwardly digest Bubs owns it. </p>
<p>Long before this you must have received a letter from me explaining why the Attorney General would not cable for money. Anyhow your money sent, arrived okay and came in very handy too darling. Still got enough money to take me to Scotland again, soon as my &ldquo;luck leave&rdquo; comes along. Of all the places I've visited Edinburgh stands out on its own, just like being among Australian people again, far different to English towns. But all the same give me the old Maitland and my two ones and home folk. It may not be very long and I'm home darling with you and Bonny Nev. </p>
<p>Can just imagine Joe Chant regarding the arrival of another girl better luck next time. Our next ought to be twins&hellip;&hellip;.. Teddy Young&rsquo;s enlisting and getting 12 months exemption, is the funniest thing I've ever heard. I don't wish to pass any remarks but you can well imagine my thoughts. So your letter number 118 was written from Toronto. How I would like to be with you and Bubs, what a great time we would have, wait till I return Sweetheart. Anxiously waiting for a letter from Nellie expressing her views regarding the name &ldquo;Fairmead&rdquo; well I imagine what she will say, Nellie does not like the name &ldquo;Fairmead&rdquo; at all she's a character without a doubt.</p>
<p>Look Nev dear.  Mummy is always telling me you have a &ldquo;paddy&rdquo; of course I don't believe it, take my advice and just  for spite play up like the very devil. But of course don't be a naughty boy. No laughing matter Neita my girl. Nothing startling has happened here lately. Have started having my meals at the officers mess, tell you kiddie it's not too bad. Have not had any further news from Keith suppose he has not yet settled down after his leave. No doubt the conscription issue was very disappointing to you all, to say nothing of our feelings. Billy Hughes is not the right man. If the National party went to the country with the same policy but a strong man at the head, a man who says a thing and carries it through instead of twisting and shuffling conscription would have been carried.</p>
<div class='closing'>
<p>Well darling I&rsquo;ll now ring off. I'm okay feeling grand hope you and Bubs are the same. Kind regards to all friends, love to Regent and Charles Street folk.</p>
<p>Love kisses and embraces to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever loving father and husband, kisses galore and oceans of love.</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for my two darlings from hubby and daddy</p>
