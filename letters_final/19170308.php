<p>Going to write this letter in pencil. Please excuse me. Do not like writing in pencil, but when the ink is very low, there's nothing else for it. Received four of your loving letters today, numbers 12,13, 14 and 15. I think I told you in a previous letter that I had received 12, 13 and 14 if so my mistake.</p>

<p>Food conditions are getting very bad and after 15th things are going to be much worse. The YMCA and Salvation Army will not be allowed to sell anything which has sugar in the making, also bread, ham, and bacon are to be cut right out. How we are to get on goodness only knows, we always fill up at the YMCA etc. I suppose we will have to go without. Anyhow I don't suppose we will starve. The other day Jeff Wynne and Russell Bryon paid me a call but unfortunately I was away at Amesbury. Nevertheless I met Jeff this afternoon in the YMCA. He is okay, looking just the thing, camped only a few hundred yards away, so, also is Tom Sawyer. Thought I had Tom's address, but no. One night wrote him a letter, having no idea what part of Lark Hill he was camped on, then much to my surprise discovered that I did not have his address, so destroyed the letter.</p>

<p>All going well, will go to see him tomorrow afternoon, now that I know his camp. Received a letter from mother the other day and as you say very pleased about Keith getting home also that military life has taken much of his shyness away for which I&rsquo;m glad. Would very much like to see my dear little wife in the purple sports coat, which she made herself, by jove kiddie you are getting clever. You mentioned not having received any letters yet, it's about time you receive some kiddie but when you do receive  my Durban  mail you are sure to receive a huge pile. The postcards received are simply great especially the one with the 5 youngsters in it. Is that supposed to be an omen dear, hope not, don't mind 1, 2 or 3 but to have 5 in one go that's too much of a joke. Don't think you would like 5 kiddies on June 27th would you darling.</p>

<p>What do I hear you saying  &ldquo;nuff said&rdquo;&hellip;..</p>

<p>Christmas was spent at Dakar and sincerely hope that next year it will be spent with my dear wife and family (how many). Sometime ago you mentioned that you had sent a parcel well it has not yet come to hand, let me know about the date you posted it. Very pleased to hear that the money is being received regularly. By jove kiddie you did well for Christmas presents but not to get one from your hubby is too bad. Look darling I am very sorry indeed fully expected to get something when in London but for some reason which I cannot explain failed to do so. While in Amesbury last Saturday tried to get something, but unsuccessful. Anyhow sweetheart the first opportunity will purchase a Christmas box and birthday present. You will be late in receiving same, but better late than never. Cannot get anything in this camp, will have to wait until I get some more leave.</p>

<p>You say write as often as possible, well I do kiddie every chance I get, but can assure you we have very little time to ourselves. When we do get a few hours off, we get as far away from the camp as possible. You keep your writing up too dear, for it is the only thing I look forward to. Waiting anxiously every night for the mail to come along. Have a good mail service here now especially newspapers. My word I did laugh when I read you did not have enough wind, but little Mac will have enough wind or noise, that's if he takes after his father, says you. Fancy being called &lsquo;mum and dad&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t be fancy but reality very soon. You did have an exciting trip to Uralla and from what you say, very lucky in indeed to get home safe and sound. You had better not take any more trips to Uralla. Do take care of your self. Very pleased to hear you are keeping in the best of health and I am getting fat. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m okay. Tons of love and kisses to my darling wife from your loving husband with kisses and embraces.</p>

<p>Don</p>

<p>Tons and tons of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   Love Don</p>
