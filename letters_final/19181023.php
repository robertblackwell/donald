<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Have been trying to write to you for several days, but have felt so depressed. You will all be wondering and waiting for a reply to your cable. Cannot yet  realise that Don -your darling Don at &ldquo;Rest&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Thought perhaps there might have been mistake but now I have heard from the Chaplain I feel it must be right and no more letters have come for me and I know he would have written. I am sure you will like to have his last letter. I wonder if he meant me to cable to you, but I really thought he would soon be feeling better and I knew perfectly well he would hate you, or his people to worry over him. He has been in hospital several times before and out again long before you had heard. How heartbroken you and his mother must be. We one and all feel it sadly here, in fact I have been unable to collect my thoughts to write to you, but I feel it must be for the best, dear.</p>

<p>Do you know that many of our gallant boys who have fought for "Peace" they now are dying with influenza. It seems so dreadful when we all want to rejoice and be thankful that those dear ones are called away.
News is still arriving from the little Ypres of boys who, have fought so well, have died this week in France.</p>

<p>I am wondering if Don wrote to you. He might have been able to write in his diary perhaps or got the nurse to. The nurse has not replied yet but I am enclosing the letter from the Chaplain. I have written for a photograph of the grave and given George full particulars too, also his friend because Rouen is not far and they might find out more. George&hellip;&hellip;. I cannot get in touch with him and I am sure he would answer. I rather favour he may have gone on leave and letter is still waiting for him. I dare not send off the cable and say he is well before I hear from him. I am glad the other cable returned to me, otherwise it would have been terrible for you. Don wrote a week before he had influenza, I believe I sent you out the letter. He was the very best one to write, always knew where to find him   &mdash;just a few lines but it was enough to satisfy one.</p>

<p>Your cable arrived which quite startled me although every post we were looking for a letter from Don. He has been the very best in writing letters, just little slips like the enclosed one, but one felt relieved.
I still think there ought to have been someone at the hospital to write or send back my letters and parcels because my address was on the outside&mdash;but  one cannot imagine the rush there in all these hospitals, with hundreds ill, even the nurses and doctors have died.
Such awful accounts have come through and we know a little distress in the village of ours. The men here have been frightfully ill and many girls have died. It's just like a hurricane. A soldier on leave brought it to the place. It seems the Best and Purist have sacrificed their lives or are marred for life and many others who have caused endless trouble return home safe and sound from France.This is how it happens in this place.
</p>

<p>Well darling, you must think and be thankful that your dear boy helped to save the world from destruction because that would have been the end had the Germans won.</p>

<p>Don worked hard at the signalling and had done excellent things. I am sure he was a perfect example to his friends. God's ways are higher than ours. Think how lovely those boys have met -Frank he was so fond of and always praised him and Sid he loved and told me many things of him which were all to his credit. Everything seems so muddling as if things had come to a dead stop. My heart aches for you and you all. How I longed for all the boys to return to you. Feel my work has been all in vain. Still the boys have sealed our living and England is once more "Free".
We shall never forget what they have done. The Australians came at once to the call. How well you have kept Don posted, with snaps which he loved. Poor darling Neville. I told Don he ought to return home at once, he needed a father to whip him. I have said many things which I ought not to have said but I am sure he understood me.</p>
<div class='closing'>
<p>Have been to London to see Bernie off, if only he was safely across should feel so happy. I wished I could have done more for your dear Don, he was so truly thankful for the least little thing.</p>

<p>My love to you and to you all
<br>Nellie</p>
