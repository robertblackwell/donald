<p>Donald Cameron McDonald was born in Maitland, NSW Australia on November 4th, 1888 of parents of Scotish and Welsh heritage.
He attended Maitland Boys High School and thereafter obtained an accountancy qualification and a position at a large wholesaling firm in Newcastle NSW.</p>

<p>On July 1st 1916 he married Neita Fry of "Wadhurst", East Maitland. Below is the report that appeared in the the Maitland "Mercury" of the event.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The Methodist Church of West Maitland was charmingly decorated for the marriage of Donald McDonald elder son of Mr and Mrs EJ McDonald* of “Glenorchy,” West Maitland, and Neita the only daughter of Mr and Mrs Richard Fry of “Wadhurst” West Maitland. The Rev W Henry Howard officiated. The bride who was given away by her father wore a charming bridal gown of white crepe de chene 
	<span class="fn">Crepe de Chene is exceedingly lustrous, but it consists of a delicate texture with an exceptional drape.</span> 
and satin with fur and pearl embroideries. The court train was lined with ruchings of fresh pink ninon and trimmed with bonito lace. Her long tulle veil was worn cap fashion with sprays of orange blossoms. She carried  a sheaf of lilies and hyacinths which with a diamond ring was the gift of the bridegroom. In attendance as bridesmaids were Miss Violet Sawyer, (friend of the bride) and Miss Eily Fry.</p>

<p>Mr Keith McDonald acted as best man and  Sergeant George Fry as groomsmen. As the bride entered the church the choir sang “The Voice that Breathed o’er Eden” and during the signing of the register they again sang “O Perfect Love.” As the bridal party left the church Miss Manall (friend of the bride) played Mendelssohn’s “Wedding March.” Following the ceremony a reception was held by Mr and Mrs Fry at their home. Later Mr and Mrs DC McDonald left for Jenolan Caves, the bride wearing a saxe blue

tailored costume and hat en suite.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Before the end of their first year of marriage, Donald would be on the ship, S. S. Benalla, bound for England, the Great War
and his fate. He sailed from Sydney on November 9th, 1916.</p>

<p>When Donald departed Neita was already expecting their first child. Their son Neville Frank Cameron McDonald was born
on June 23rd 1917. Donald was not present at the birth and never got to meet his son.</p>

<p>Donald passed away from influenza on October 22nd 1918, mere weeks before an armistice was signed that ended the war.
Today he rests in the Imperial War Graves Cemetery near Rouen, France.</p>

<p>The letters, and other material, reproduced in this book tell the story of Donald's experiences between the dates of 
November 9th 1916 and October 22nd 1918. </p>
