<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Today Is a beautiful day, instead of going out will remain at home and write to my darling wife, it would never do miss writing to you, would it sweetheart? Yesterday was a great day, received one of your letters number 120, the first letter for over a fortnight. You can well imagine how pleased I was. There are more hanging about, for Nellie informed me yesterday, she had forwarded me several. I used to get her to re-address them care of YMCA but it is under isolation owing to an outbreak of measles, so by the time they are sent from the YMCA to the field post office and then to our own post office there's a good deal of delay. Anyhow your letter I received yesterday had been addressed to the YMCA so now they have started to come the others are sure to follow very shortly. Early in the week I received a letter from Keith. He is okay and going strong, mentioned having received your photo also of the &lsquo;nipper&rsquo;. Said he is&rdquo;some kid&rdquo;.&rsquo;  So he is, eh darling. Things have been terrible in camp during the week every one is on pins and needles waiting for their turn to be warned for France. So far I have weathered the storm, but for how long I'll last, have no idea. My right hand man Bob Watson, who has been exceedingly good to me and done everything in his power to keep me here has himself been warned for draft and expects to be leaving for his depot in about a weeks time. It's practically impossible to remain here for any length of time now. But darling you can rest assured for your two dear sakes I'll do my utmost.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon I went into Warminster to purchase a few articles, pipe etc. Returned to camp about 6:30, had tea then went to the pictures. Very good program indeed. It was after returning to camp that I received your letter also one from Nellie. Two parcels also came to hand one from the Patterson Fry&rsquo;s and one from Nellie. Nellie&rsquo;s contained cakes and by jove kiddie they were grand. Polished them all off at supper. It was some supper too I can tell you. I wish I were at Toronto with you all what a good time we would have and as for carrying you and Bubs on my back would do it with the greatest pleasure and carry all the rest of the children we're going to have too. More the better, but I'm afraid it would be a case of &ldquo;poor dad&rdquo;. Anyhow I'll chance it. Look here kiddie you say Bubs is wild and has an outrageous temper, well I don't believe you, it's impossible. Don't think you can manage children. I'll have to get back and show you how to do things. He'd be good to me that I am sure.</p>
<p>So you received my signatures as for framing them, a very good plan, but as for hanging them in the dining room or kitchen I do not agree with you, the best place to hang then would be in the little house down in the corner of the yard. The photo is certainly for Neville and by jove if he does not get it look out &ldquo;my little wife&rdquo;, for you&rsquo;ll get it right on the &hellip;. and on the lips. I've sent one to both of you so I don't think there'll be a fight between you two.
Aunt Edie&rsquo;s parcel came just at the right moment, with the potted ham and sardines together with Nellie&rsquo;s cakes I had a jolly good feed, was feeling dead hungry at the time too. Bernie is out of bed walking about, going to concerts so he must be getting along, first rate. George is well, he also received I parcel from Nellie yesterday. Food is getting very scarce throughout England. Nellie sent me the enclosed cutting*, not too bad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My Tuesdays are meatless, <br>
My Wednesdays are wheatless.<br>
I am getting more eatless each day,<br>
My home it is heatless<br>
My bed it is sheetlets,<br>
They're all sent to the YMCA.<br>
That bar-rooms are treatless,<br>
My coffee is sweetless.<br>
Each day I get poorer and wiser,<br>
My stockings are feetless,<br>
My trousers are seatless. <br>
My! How I do hate the Kaiser!<br></p>

<p>She said if I were in that state, that you sweetheart would come straight over to Blighty. Well I am so come dearest and don't forget to bring Bubs with you. Suppose Nellie has told you about Elsie Morris&rsquo;s bad luck. She was engaged to a flying man. Last week while flying his machine fell, with the result he was killed. She was very wrapped up in him, feel very sorry for her, may drop her a line in a day or so.
What do you think of the Russians. They are going to make things very unpleasant for the Western front. No signs yet of the great offensive starting but it cannot be very long ere things are doing. The Allies are sure to be pushed back but that's about all. Will the war never end, prospects don't look too bright at present. The sooner it starts, the better, for the Germans are getting stronger every day, but their strength is sure to break.</p>

<p>Darling kiddie I&rsquo;ll now ring off. Love and kisses to my own dear wife and darling son from your loving hubby and daddy with scores and scores of kisses and oceans of love.</p>
<p>Husband and father</p>
