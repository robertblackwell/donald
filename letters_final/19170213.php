<p>Who is this says you, well darling it&rsquo;s supposed to be your hubby. Sketched for <?php render_pence(2); ?> by an old man on the Thames Embankment on Sunday morning 11th of January 1917.  Do you think it's like me, Kiddie? If you could have only seen me posing for it and dozens of people looking on. Never forget it. Had a mad fit on, I think.</p>
