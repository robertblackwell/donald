<p>Have written you Kiddie giving particulars of my time at Christmas. Here are a couple of postcards which will give you some idea of the place. It's a very fine old place but not as good as other English homes I’ve  been to. Had my photo taken at the entrance of the “Mile Drive” if it turns out well, will send my dear along one. The lake, Shearwater Is undoubtedly very pretty, was frozen over. Of course had to try my hand at skating. A few falls but that's all in the game. How would you like to spend a holiday there kiddie, bet we three would have a good time, eh sweetheart. Was speaking to George yesterday afternoon. He had just returned from five days leave at Hemsley’s Bexley Heath, needless to say he had a glorious time. George lost his job in the orderly room, but has had the good luck to get another job in the quarter masters store. Received a letter from Keith, still in France, but is expecting to be in Blighty any day. He is having a real good time at present. Also received letters from Nellie and Dorothy. Yesterday I wanted to buy a few small things so walked into Warminster, stayed there for a few hours and returned to camp about 7.30 o'clock. Darling I'll be leaving this camp for Heytesbury Camp sometime this week. Don't know where I'm doing right or wrong. In a good job at present a lasting job, but was offered another lasting job at Heytesbury and I accepted it. Taking charge of the signal school, orderly room. Conditions are far better, fair amount of leave.  The boys reckon I'm lucky. In my next letter will give you more particulars. Not advisable to write them on postcards. How did you and Bubs spend Christmas? Hope you had a really good time. Sincerely hope to be home with my two darlings this time next year. There are quite a number of the ‘Benalla’ boys in camp at present. Au revoir for the present. Love kisses and embraces to my darling wife and dear bonny sun from your ever own and loving husband  and father.</p>
