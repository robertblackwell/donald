<p>It is just a week since I last wrote, kiddie, why I've delayed is that I have been working a lot at night, also expected to have some good news for you and been anxiously waiting every day for it. What's the news you want to know, eh kiddie, sorry to say it did not come off. There was a very good job vacant at our headquarters Salisbury which I thought I could get. Will tell you, minutes ago my luck  ran out. It was the job of auditor. Will have to try and square the Dr to mark me C3. Very disappointed better luck next time. Anyhow I had three good days in Salisbury with theatre and good sleep ins, each morning. </p>
<p>Received a letter from Fred Wade the other day, he is in France and going strong. Last Saturday went to Warminster had a look around, a good feed and then home to bed. Sunday afternoon went to the artillery camp at Heytesbury to see some of the boys, suppose it will not be very long and I go to Heytesbury camp. Received a letter from a mate of mine in Salisbury, telling me of the job and for me to apply to headquarters London for it, which I did. Later I received word to interview the officer at Salisbury. Off I went saw him, suited him right down to the ground but my classification A3 was against me. Anyhow he went to London and while there did his best, with the result I missed. C3 men (unfit for active service) is what they want, but they tried several camps with out success. C3 men want to get straight away back to Australia.</p>
<p>Got word just a few falling. Ice everywhere, water taps frozen, sliding here there and everywhere, it's no joke I can assure you. Have been with George a few times lately, he is okay and expects to be going on five days Christmas leave on Sunday. 10% of the men are getting five days Christmas leave and 10% New Years. I'm getting off next week for a few days and hope to go to Bath. I'm in a pretty good home at present 20 blankets makes a good bed, what say you darling. Supper every night. Saturday's supper, potato pie, tea, bread and butter. Sunday grilled steak liver, bacon,  tea, bread and butter. Tuesday soup, steak bread and butter, fruit and tonight we are having salmon, tea and toast etc . It's not too bad I can tell you kiddie. </p>
<p>How is darling Bubs  getting on, every day I get more anxious than ever for the war to end so that I will be able to get back to you dear one, and darling Neville. I can't hurry the end, so will have to wait and wait. Would give all I possess to have dear bubs with me tonight. Kiddie you have no idea how I long to be back  with my two darlings but I always say &ldquo;buck up&rdquo; Mac. </p>
<p>Received a letter from Mrs Suttin at &lsquo;Halls&rdquo;. It contained photos of all the girls etc at the office, also several notes from different ones on the staff. She told me about you sweetheart, being in with bubs and what a beautiful boy, she said just like his father, eh what beautiful. Also got a very old letter from Keith. Have not heard anything yet of his being in Blighty, but expect him any day now. The weather has been bitterly cold of late. Sunday for the first time we had a fall of snow and every day since.</p>

<p>I suppose Neville is getting to be quite a little man, don't put him in long trousers too soon dear one. Fancy Christmas next week how time flies, thought I would be back in Australia by this Christmas, surely next one will see me with my two darlings. Sent the last of my photos away today to Annie and Dorothy Roberts. Fritz has been smashing London up again. </p>
<p>Au revoir for the present with love kisses and embraces to my darling wife and bonny son, with scores and scores of kisses and oceans of love from your ever own and loving husband and father.</p>
