<p>Have just returned from the dentist. He just started a job of stopping two teeth, tomorrow morning I have to go again when I will be finished. There's a draft leaving here on Friday which I'm certain to be on. We first go to Sutton Veny*, a sorting up camp, will only be there a few days and then move on to our artillery camp. The staying in the artillery camp is very uncertain, may be a week or maybe a month, just ones luck. Do not like the idea of leaving here, rise at 7 o&rsquo;clock, breakfast 7:45, fall in at 9 AM. 3/4 of an hours route march, after that 1/2 hour jerks, then about an hour's football. Dinner at 12:45. Fall in at 2 PM, route march  till 3 PM football until 4 o&rsquo;clock. Tea at 4:45. Concert or vaudeville and pictures at night. Weekends off from Saturday midday till Sunday midnight, able to go anywhere you like on condition there's no traveling on trains. So you say darling things are not too bad here. </p>
<p>Yesterday I received a letter from Flo Roberts. The day before one from Mrs Crowley. Think I told you about her letter. She is working at the Ladies Canteen at headquarters Horseferry Road from 9 AM to 6 PM Monday to Friday. Her hubby has just recently gone over to France. She offered me assistance regarding money and clothing wants me to call on her the next time I'm in London. Told me Eric Hewitt had been wounded but had gone into camp at Sutton Veny so no doubt I will see him at the end of the week. Sweetheart I have to consider myself very lucky to have been away from France during the last few months. The Australian casualties for August September and October are within the vicinity of 70,000 and we heard today that the 4th and 5th Division are being disbanded to reinforce the 2nd and 3rd. There should never have been a 4th and 5th division for the reinforcements from Australia were never sufficient.</p>
<p>Suppose that you received my letter asking you to send a tenner, also another asking for a further fiver. Wrote to  Nellie the other day for the loan of a few shillings. </p>
<div class='closing'>
<p>No more news sweetheart. How is our darling boy getting on, take good care of him dearest, until I get home, which may not be so very long now. What I give to be able to nurse him on one knee and you dear on the other. Wait till I return. What a time we will have, to be sure.
Au revoir for the present darling. My photos have not yet come to hand, written about them but no reply.</p>
<p>Love and kisses to my sweetheart wife, and darling son from your ever own and loving husband and dad with oceans and oceans of love and kisses to my two darlings.</p>
<p>Hubby and daddy</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>PS. Hurry up with some photos of Neville sweetheart, those you sent me are simply bosker but I want some of our darling a little older. Love and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>

<p>Hurdcott The camp located at&nbsp;Compton Chamberlayne&nbsp;and close to Fovant (and the Fovant badges, pictured right) became known as Hurdcott Camp as it was on land that was part of two farms, one of which bore that name. Australian battalions moved to Hurdcott in 1916, and in March 1917 Hurdcott House became the headquarters of&nbsp;No.3 Command Depot&nbsp;for the AIF. At the camp practice trenches were dug, together with a bayonet fighting assault course close to a bombing ground, and five huts were transformed into a camp hospital. In November 1917&nbsp;No.4 Command Depot&nbsp;moved from Codford to Hurdcott. By January 1919 the command depots had all but ceased to function in their primary use and were now receiving men from France on their way back home.</p>
<p>**Sutton Veny - 1st World War</p>
<p>The proximity of Sutton Veny to Warminster and Salisbury Plain ensured that Sutton Veny and the surrounding villages in the upper Wylye Valley area, was an ideal location to barrack troops in order for them to train prior to deploying to northern France. Supplies arrived via the Salisbury to Warminster railway line, and in November 1914 a railway&nbsp;spur from Heytesbury was laid the few miles to Sutton Veny to convey camp building materials and water for the troops. Approximately 10 Camps were built around Sutton Veny.</p-->
