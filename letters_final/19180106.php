<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>Been having our share of cold weather lately, plenty of snow and ice about but today it's much milder, raining slightly. So kiddie considering the state of the weather, think it best to sit near the fire and write to my two darlings. Have a few other letters to write as well, Nellie, Sid and the grandmas. Keith has not yet put in an appearance, hope he hangs up for another fortnight, when I expect to be getting a week off. Scotland will certainly be my objective. What about taking the trip with me darling, bet we would give Neville a good time, eh what! and have a great time ourselves to be sure.</p>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Thursday I received a letter from Dorothy, said she had two letters and parcel for Keith, wanted to know what to do with them, as she was expecting him over. Told her to hang onto them. He must be over here any day now. Also received the photo  &ldquo;Bubs&rdquo; from grandma. It's a boska, tell you darling I was overjoyed to receive it. Isn't he a bonny kid. Will this war never end so as to allow me to get back to my darling. I have great hopes of settlement in the near future, going home to my love ones.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had the good fortune to receive a parcel from Phyll, tell you we made way into it last night. Met quite a number of old pals in Warminster yesterday, &ldquo;Benalla boys&rdquo;. There was great talking going on. Warminster is a great place to meet friends, the reason being all the Australian camps are situated nearby. For this military district there are 22 Australian camps. Returned to camp about 6 o&rsquo;clock, sat around the fire, smoking and telling yarns, had supper and turned into bed about 9:30. Just received a letter from Nellie saying she had received &pound;20, a tenner for George and myself. Just the thing sweetheart, very pleased indeed to get it. Now there is no doubt about my not having a good time in Scotland. Have a few pounds in my belt so that together with my pay (have not drawn any pay for over six weeks) and the tenner they'll be something doing. Why are you sweetheart and bubs, not with me. Wait till I return then there's sure to be something doing. Also received a &ldquo;Christmas letter&rdquo; from Frank E Fry. In case you were wondering what has become of the tobacco pouch that Vi gave me, well, I've still got it and it's doing great work. Never been out of my pocket since the day I got it. You remember the blue silk flag  I waved leaving Sydney, still in my pocket. Brings back memories. I'll wave it on my return, kiddie. What a day that will be. Nellie is a dear character, goes in raptures  over  &ldquo;Bubs&rdquo; photos. She passes all sorts of remarks. Said she received the photos, but grandma tops it with a &ldquo;superb&rdquo; picture. </p>

<div class='closing'

<p>In one of your letters you said Sid had &pound;2 for me, well I've heard nothing more about it, so going to drop him a line straightaway. Bet your life I'll make good use of it.</p>

<p>Well darling I'll ring off now. Remember me to all our friends. Love to all at Regent and Charles Streets. Hope all  are keeping in best of health. I&rsquo;m grand. Love kisses any embraces to my own dear wife and darling son from your ever loving husband and father with oceans and oceans of love and kisses.</p>

<p>Don</p>
