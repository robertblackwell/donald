<p>Have not received any letters for over a fortnight, trifle disappointed but suppose they will come along shortly anyhow I sincerely hope that would hurry up. Kiddie I have not too much time to myself so please tell anyone expecting letters from me not to be disappointed if none come along but of course I will do my best, but you sweetheart that's another story, will always keep your letters up to date. I&rsquo;ve been doing very well, don't think you can grumble on that score, in fact I'm sure. Received an answer to my letter from George yesterday dated 15th March 1917 France. Very short letter indeed, said he was well and that they were giving Fritz hell. George must do a lot of writing to girls, a very funny thing happened in his letter. This is exactly how he finished up.  </p>
<p>Don, I'm in a hell of a hurry so will close with kisses from yours sincerely George.</p>
<p>He had written with kisses, saw his mistake and then scratched the two words out. </p>
<p>Food is still an important point in our camp. Tucker has been slightly better this week. Absolutely every particle of food from the table is saved and hashed up again. Leavings of bread for bread puddings, all scraps of meat and vegetables made into a sort of hash. The numerous parts not fit for human consumption are put through certain processes for the manufacture of ammunition etc. There is not a single scrap wasted. This is what the war has told England, economy, and if the lesson which England has learned is still heeded after the war, well the country will be greater and greater than ever. It's marvelous the waste that has gone on, especially in the army, but now nothing, absolutely nothing is wasted. All along the lines in front of our huts trees have been grown so when they shoot up they will greatly improve the appearance of the camp. Cabbages are being grown with a vengeance. Between all the huts plants have been planted, looks like a Chinese garden. England is making a great attempt to be self supporting, to a certain degree. If everything is carried out as planned Salisbury Plains after the war will be a gigantic vegetable garden. </p>
<p>I am enclosing a couple of photos which may be of interest to you. The conditions of the signal school are improving. Up till lately we always had to give a hand at the stables, but that has been cut out. Tomorrow we are leaving our present camp No 21 to No 26. There we are told it will be possible to get weekend leave. That's just what we want. If we get this leave then darling, you are sure to get a cable asking for money. Another batch of our November quota are leaving for France on Sunday night. When they go, there will not be many of us left. Of course we signalers cannot go on draft until we have passed right through. About another 8 weeks ought to see me a full blossomed signaler. I may say that signaling ( as we have to know it) is absolutely the hardest branch in the army to learn.</p>
<p>Wrote to head quarters inquiring about Keith, received an answer today. They know nothing about him so far. </p>
<p>Wednesday and Thursday snow fell continuously. Snow balling was in full swing, and of course yours truly did his share.</p>
<p>Well dearest wife, how are you getting on, suppose you are anxiously waiting for the great event, buck up sweetheart all will be well. I'm always thinking of you and hoping everything will be okay, which I'm sure it will be. There will be great excitement in dear old Maitland then.</p>
<div class='closing'>
<p>Wish I could be with you darling but never mind I'll get back to you and little Mac as soon as I possibly can, you can rest assured of that point. I'm keeping good health and feel just the thing. Give my love to the <?php render_mother("Mater");?> and tell the <?php render_father("boss");?> to hurry up with a letter or two.</p>
<p>With tons and tons of kisses to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband with kisses and embraces galore.</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>Here are a few more sweetheart xxxxxxxxxxxxx by jove I&rsquo;ll make things hum when I get back to you love. Bet your life eh Kiddie.</p>
