<p>Today is Tuesday the day of the great royal review. This morning we were up at 5:45 AM breakfast at 6 o&rsquo;clock, parade at 6:15, started to march to the parade at Bulford at 7 o'clock. It was a glorious day, sun shining the whole day. We arrived at Bulford about 8 o'clock and then had to wait until 12 o'clock for his majesty to put in an appearance. Shortly after 12 noon he arrived and the March Past started. It was a glorious sight, there were between 30 and 40,000 Australian soldiers, every branch of the service. Had a very good view of the King and his staff. After the review we all lined up along one of the country roads and waited the passing along of the king. When he came along he was cheered again and again by the boys. Here again I had a very close look at King George. We eventually returned to camp arriving about 3 o'clock after a very pleasant outing. The remainder of the day was a holiday. As for the Kings leave we know nothing but hoping against hope for a few days off. A moving picture was taken of the review. This picture will be shown in Australia in about eight weeks time. Did not see Keith. His unit was right away at the other end of the parade ground and only having 10 minutes off for lunch did not have time to go and see him. In all probability I will see him next Sunday.</p>

<p>One has to go away from home to hear news. What do you think of this? A lady gave birth to a child and naturally applied for that 5 pound bonus. She only received four pound five shillings. Immediately she wrote to Billy Hughes the Prime Minister of Australia and asked him the reason her cheque was 5 shillings short. She received an answer stating that five shillings had been deducted for "amusement tax". Well if that's not the limit. Certainly there is a good deal of amusement to be derived  (...) until the child is born, but to deduct five shillings and call it amusement, beats the band.</p>

<p>Cannot understand why you are not receiving my letters kiddie. I write several times a week and lately I have practically written every day. So when you start to receive them you should do very well. Don't suppose you mind how many you receive my dearest. In your letter Number 25 you say you will wire particular's of the great event. That's right kiddie. I'm anxiously waiting for the time to come, it seems a very long time until June 24th, but as you say love it will surely come but slowly. Then it will be mum this and mum that, dad this and dad that, how great. Would give anything to be home with you darling, but afraid that cannot be but you can rest assured I'll be home to you and Little Mac as soon as I possibly can kiddie, then we three will have the time of our lives, what say you darling. Very pleased to know that the property has been fixed up. The boss is writing and giving me full particulars have not received the letter yet. The particulars you gave me, I consider very good. It's undoubtedly a paying proposition, of that I am certain. Will have more to say about it when I receive the letter from the Pata<span class='fn'>a reference to Don's father</span>. Anyhow I am well satisfied and and sure the boss<span class='fn'>another, different, reference to Don's father</span> is.</p>

<p>What would I give darling to see you making the little clothes, a great deal to be sure. Yes kiddy it will be without a doubt the most wonderful baby in the world and why not when he is ours, eh sweetheart. </p>

<p>Great news in the papers  today regarding the war, when you get the news, kiddie you'll be greatly pleased. Big advance by the British and French, 24,000 German prisoners.</p>

<p>In your letter Number 30 you mention about the pony strikes being very funny, yes darling, would certainly, have enjoyed seeing you, being stuck up by the pony, but of course, I would have come to your help.</p>

<p>So little Mac has heavy boots on, hope you are having a good time with him, wish I were with you, darling so that I could enjoy hearing his heavy walking. The front room downstairs is certainly the best room. I'm very pleased that you have written to Nellie Fry, of course, as I have told you, I have written several times to her.</p>
<div class='closing'>
<p>Darling, there is one thing certain if our baby Is a boy he will never be a soldier. That's what I am saying now. Well sweetheart  I am over pleased to know how well you are, good health is the secret of a successful  &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; great event&hellip; so keep in good health darling. Look after yourself, take great care of yourself and Mac until I return then everything will be just the thing, especially as soon as we get into our home. Will now close darling, I'm feeling just the thing. With tons and tons of kisses to my loving wife from your ever own and loving husband.</p>

<p>Don</p>

<p>Kisses from here around the world a couple of times then to my darling XXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>

<p>Love Don</p>
