<p>The postcards which you sent Bubs are just the thing. Of course I've never been like the man on the cards, all the same I don't think it's too bad of a complaint these times. Your mum is very naughty saying you are a dirty boy, so next time you are doing some cake walking on her tummy, give an extra kick from me,  hard as you like.</p>
<p>Had a letter from Keith, not in Blighty yet, soon as he arrives, I'm off for a few days. The weather here at present is fairly mild, but Nellie tells me that down their way it is 18&deg;, frost, pipes broken, no hot water.</p>
<p>Bernie was on his way to Kent the other week, was in London walking along the Strand when he slipped and fell on his stump. Taken to St George's Hospital for a week and then taken back to Southall. This will put him back a couple of months. Most unfortunate and I feel very sorry for him. </p>
<p>Yesterday I had a glorious day, letters from dad, mum, Harry Curtis  (card) Grandpa and Grandma Fry, Madge, Phyll 2 and yourself sweetheart 3. The numbers kiddie are 107, 113, 114. Also dear I received the cake and Neville&rsquo;s parcel just grand. The cake could not have been in better condition, the icing was broken a little at the edges but the wording was as good as the day it was put on. Tell you the boys and myself greatly appreciated it last night, a feed of decent cake. Darling Bubs parcel was okay except for one broken cigar. That's very good, could not expect anything better than that eh kiddie. And the contents, just what's needed. The ginger has disappeared, half the biscuits, coffee and milk we had for supper last night. Tell you darling we had a great feast. The cigars will do when on my trip to Scotland, some swank, eh what. Not too much of the fancy work &lsquo;sports&rdquo;. They wanted me to have a go at it while in hospital, no thank you, books and papers were more in my line.</p>
<p>Fancy Uncle Charlie Fry marrying again, how&rsquo;s Aunt Minnie, dear old soul. Would like to have been under the bed on the first night. Wonder was there anything doing.</p>

<p>I'm awfully pleased to hear you are getting my letters etc okay. Can just imagine you love receiving 40 parcels and seven letters. The bulletin that came in the parcel and the Mercury around the cake have been read from beginning to end. Quite a sensation among the boys when the Bulletin came to light. The photos enclosed are just okay. Bubs in the chair is great, how I wish I could give him a huge kiss. No kiddie I&rsquo;d never spoil him, never, eh what. But sweetheart why don't you part his hair. The garden looks good, wish I were there now kiddie rolling on the grass with Bubs, to say nothing of his mother. I'm grand, hope darling Bubs and yourself the same. Love and tons of kisses to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever own loving husband and father.</p>
<p>To Neville and Neita</p>
<p>Love Don</p>
