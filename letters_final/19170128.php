<p>The Australian mail closes tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock so will therefore write a few lines. Still at the same camp of which there is nothing to tell you except that it is still cold, bitterly cold. Yesterday and today, a very strong wind has been blowing. If you send any papers make them up like a parcel for if tied in the usual way they will not be delivered. Only yesterday two large baskets of papers belonging to some of the men were burnt.</p>
<p>Of course I would like some Mercury&rsquo;s so wrap them parcel shape. On Friday I received a very nice letter from Mrs. S Smith. Of course she wants me to go and spend my leave with her. Cannot do that but will most certainly call and see her and possibly stay one night. Will send you a copy of the letter for you to read my dear. Yesterday I also received a letter from Nellie Fry. She wants me to go there  as soon as I get off. She explained how I could get there and what sort of time they would give me. Also I am to call her cousin. She said she was writing to Mr. Hemsley  telling him that I am here, also she wrote to her brother-in-law George Davis   (she gave me his address as well) who is in Lark Hill camp.</p>
<p>Number one I intended going to see Mr Hemsley this afternoon, but yesterday I went for a walk and just as I got back he walked into the hut. We were together for about three hours, had supper together. He is in the motor transport hut, but his right leg met with an accident so that he expects to get his discharge sooner or later.   I suppose you have heard all about him, aged 40, married, two children girls ages 10 and 12. He told me all about Goudhurst and  how they would enjoy my visit. Of course have decided to go there and drive from there to Mrs. Smith. He and George met several times and he said that George looked the picture of health. Nellie Fry had a letter from George the other day. He had been in the trenches and out and was going in again. </p>
<p>When we are to get our leave, nobody knows, don't think we will ever get it, but when we do I am off to the hop District, Goudhurst, after what I was told last night. Yesterday afternoon spent a very good time at Figheldean. It is a village about 2 miles from here. The items of interest were Longfellow&rsquo;s well known chestnut tree and blacksmith shop. Had my photos taken under the tree also had a good look at the shop. The church is opposite where is marked the exact position the blacksmiths daughter sang. Outside is his grave. After having a good look round the village we had afternoon tea which was great.  I bought a couple of postcards which I will send you, they will give you an exact idea of the place. </p>
<p>Tucker is the chief thing here, last night came across a good spot, two sausages with plenty of peas and potatoes also a cup of tea for 9p. Ink has just run out will get some more tomorrow. Have been going hard all day intended to do a little study regarding the signals but could not get five minutes to myself. Have been making numerous inquiries regarding the signal business over at the front from men who have been over there. They reckon it is the best job over there but that only applies to the artillery.</p>
<p>Well darling wife will now say au revoir until next letter which I will write in a few days. How are you and how is little Mac? Sincerely hope you are going along swimmingly. I am keeping in the best of health. Remember me to all. Love to all at home and Wadhurst. </p>
<p>Love, kisses and embraces to my darling wife from your own true hubby.</p>
<p>Tons of kisses</p>
<p>Don
</p>
<p>I am enclosing the letter received, will have to destroy it after a while so I think it would be better in your hands dearest. Love to self and Little Mac from hubby and father. Eh what. Eh what.</p>
