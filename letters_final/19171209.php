<p>Well kiddie, I'm still at Sand Hill and going strong but one never knows when you are likely to slip and have to get a move on. The job is good free passes to the pictures, 11 and 3 o&rsquo;clock, tea  from the cookhouse and as much bread as I  need from the store. Will do me if it lasts. After finishing your last letter love, I made off and picked George up. We first had a cup of tea etc and then made off to the pictures. George is okay and leading a gay life. Met two Maitland boys here the other day, Alf Prichard and a chap named Bidwell, he married one of the Stubberfield girls. Mum is sure to know of him. Yesterday afternoon I went into Warminster, had a look around and tea at the &ldquo;Bath Arms.&rdquo; Tell you, kiddie it was some tea cost five shillings. Get to go into town for a decent feed sometimes, considering that we are on starvation food. At night went to a show given by the &ldquo;Magpies&rdquo; a concert party from this camp. It was in aid of the hospital. Was going to the pictures tonight missed my mates and being very cold thought the best plan would be to return to the hut, sit by the fire and write a few lines to my dear old sweetheart. Trying to arrange for a few days in Salisbury, a mate of mine Gerry Gerrett wants me to go in badly. He has a staff job there. Wish I could get there with him. The weather is getting cold now, every day lately the water in the pipes has been frozen, but up to the present no signs of snow, may it keep away.</p>
<p>Met Jim Kerr while there. Today I received two letters one from Mrs Smith and one from Keith. Mrs Smith is a dear character. She wants to know all about Keith, tells me your letters are the loveliest letters written. Those to me sweetheart undoubtedly are. Keith is okay and having a good time. They are camped near a large town, where they go every night to amusement of different kinds. He has also received a Christmas parcel from the Girls League. This paper is from the pad which came in my parcels.</p> 
<p>Wonder what your opinions are concerning the war. Not too bright I should say. The question asked here every day,  is &ldquo;are we winning&rdquo;. General answer, NO. Things look undoubtedly black. Russia has upset everything. Will be interesting to see what the States will do.</p> 

<p>Tuesday and Wednesday are polling days<span class='fn'>a referendum in Australia seeking to introduce conscription</span>, the majority of the boys are  voting NO. That's what they say at  any rate.</p>

<p>Kiddie I have a number of cigarette cards, I suppose Charlie is still saving them, so will enclose a few in each letter. If Charlie does not want them, they're sure to be some kiddies that would like them. How is my darling baby getting on? Wish I had him with me now near the fire, would be simply glorious if I had my two love ones over this side with me, what a great time we would have, eh sweetheart. Au revoir for the present darling, Love kisses and embraces to my dear sweetheart and bonny son with oceans and oceans of kisses, your ever own loving and sincere husband and father.</p>
<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX To my two darlings</p>
