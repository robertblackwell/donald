<blockquote><p>Mrs McDonald of Charles Street West Maitland was advised last evening of the death of her husband Donald Cameron McDonald, who died from bronchial pneumonia on October 22. He sailed  for the front on November 9th 1916 and was serving with the field artillery. He was previously wounded in France. Prior to enlisting he had been employed for a number of years as accountant to a Newcastle wholesale house. Gunner McDonald was well known in Maitland and was very popular with all his acquaintances. He was the elder son of Mr E J Mc Donald of West Maitland and his brother Keith is serving in France as a driver with the Motor Transport. He leaves one young son and much sympathy will also be expressed with Mrs McDonald who has had one brother Sergeant Frank Fry killed in action. Her other brother George is still serving in France.</p>
