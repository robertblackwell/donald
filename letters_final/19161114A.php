<p>I am enclosing a few postcards of Cape Town. There were not very many good sights, the Esplanade and Table Mountain being the best. We are in the danger zone now, lights out at sunset, portholes closed, after tomorrow lifebelts will have to be worn all day. Expect to arrive at our next port tomorrow will write you a letter then sweetheart. Ink has run out, when there will be plenty of news.</p>
<div class='closing'>
<p>Hope you are in the best of health. To my darling wife from your ever true loving husband with XXXXX Don</p>
