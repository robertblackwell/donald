<h2>LARK HILL, 25th March 1917</h2>

<p>My darling wife</p>

<p>Sunday night, just discovered that my pen is empty cannot fill same until tomorrow hence these few lines in pencil dear. Yes today three of us went on another walking tour. Left camp at 1:30 pm and after walking about 2 miles through hedged roads and through plowed fields arrived at the village of West Amesbury which is undoubtedly very pretty. On we walked with mountains to our right, and the River Avon some 200 feet to our left. It is marvelous how this river winds around the country, every village one visits, the River Avon is sure to be seen. The next village we passed through was Wilsford, here we had a good look around and as usual visited the church. These churches usually date back about 500 years, very interesting indeed. Then we passed through the prettiest country I've ever seen, beautiful hedged roads and numerous streams of the Avon. Here the river widens out in several places, this locality is called “ The Lakes”. The village of The Lakes is  extremely beautiful. It is here that a great number of wealthy people live, their homes, gardens and fields are simply glorious. On we went and passed through Woodford. This village is very much like the others, farming and vegetable gardening carried out extensively. On several farms, girls were helping work the farm but our experience is that the work done by these girls is very little. They are trying to do their bit, it's good exercise for them, that's about all the good that is derived out of the energies. Next place we visited was Great Dumford. This place Australian soldiers are very seldom seen, youngsters were running after us, and walking up the street with us, greatly to our amusement. Women standing at the doors of their homes would sing out “hello Australia” etc. Now our good luck came. A beautiful house appeared in front of us, so seeing a lady coming along wheeling her baby  in a pram I stopped her and asked her particulars about this place. It happened to be the Manor House. Just as she was leaving, she said, if you gentlemen happen to be looking for tea she would be very pleased to supply same for a nominal fee. Just what we wanted. Viewed the church and then made for her home. Very nice place and scrupulously clean. While waiting for tea  I nursed the baby, a lovely girl about 2 years old. She was in her glory. Getting my eye in darling, thoroughly enjoyed myself. What will I be like when I am nursing our son, darling that will be the time, sweetheart. When this little girls mother came in, on one occasion she said “Mother fancy me sitting on a soldier lap but I am so comfortable”. Shortly tea came in, this is what I had 2 eggs, 8 pieces of bread and butter, also strawberry jam (all home  made) 3 slices of cake, and 3 cups of tea. The cost 1/8p. There were three of us so that made five shillings but we added an extra one shilling for the baby. The mother could not thank us enough. After tea we started back for camp. This part of the country with its numerous streams from the Avon Is absolutely the finest country in scenery, I've ever seen. Our walk back was along the Avon River, word's fail to describe the beauty. Finally we arrived in Amesbury where we procured fruit. Eventually arrived back after walking through the finest country for scenery, rivers, villages, farms etc. at 8:30 pm. We covered a little more than 12 miles. </p>

<p>This afternoon three of us left camp for a walk, have no idea where we were going, anyhow we passed through Durrington, Bulford and on to Bulford  camp. Here we intended to call on some of our boys, but being such a large camp nobody seemed to know where they were camped. After mooning about for about half an hour we got disgusted with the whole business so decided to walk back to our own camp. We started with a few curses on our tongues, passed through a wood onto the main road. The first soldier I ran into was, who do you think, well Keith. He is camped at Park House about 9 miles from our camp. He was going to Bournemouth but having to go on duty decided to take a walk to Bulford. Strange that we two should make for the same camp. and to meet, for this camp covers miles and miles of country, must have been fate that brought us together. He is looking well and feeling fit but like all of us complains about not getting leave and the shortage of food. He has not received any letters from home since he arrived in England which was three weeks ago. All that he has received were a couple of Mercury’s. He expects disembarkation leave next week, if he gets it, well London will find him. If he does not go on leave we have arranged to meet at Bulford Rahway Station next Sunday. Off course  meeting there makes it about half way for both of us 4 1/2 miles each. No doubt you can imagine our surprise on seeing one another and how pleased we both were. Could not talk fast enough, first he would want to know something, then I would ask questions. Time was very short as he had to get back to duty. Anyhow next Sunday we will have more time together. We went to Durrington  for tea and returned to camp about 7 o’clock.</p>

<p>Well darling I’ll now ring off, hope you are keeping in best of health and everything progressing favorably for the great event. </p>

<p>Love and kisses to my darling wife from your own sincere and loving husband with tons of kisses and embraces.</p>
