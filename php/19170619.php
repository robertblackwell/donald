<h2>France, 19 June 1917</h2>

<p>My darling wife</p>

<p>Your ever loving letter Number 39, reached me yesterday. It is the first letter of yours kiddie that I have received since arriving in France, hence greatly pleased. It was simply grand to get one off my dearâ€™s letters after such a long spell without any. In addition to your letter,  kiddie I received one from Aunty For, Vi, George, Fred Wade and two from Keith, so considered my luck was in. George was in hospital at Boulogne with diphtheria. His letter took three weeks to find me and at the time of his writing he was doing well and expected to be leaving with in a  week or so. I wrote him straight away. The letter from Fred was written in England just after I left. Keith was still in Blighty but expected a moved very shortly. He received the sweets etc you sent him on his birthday and by jove he was pleased, simply great so he says. He has bought a camera, send me a photo of himself taken by same, very good indeed. He asked my opinion regarding the transport, told him to keep in it as it was the best branch all the service. It is absolutely. News is very scarce, still posting but think the post is nearing its end. There is something in the air concerning peace in the near future, sincerely hope it is true so that I can get back to you sweetheart and little Mac. It is the opinion of all that this year will about see it out. Should have had today off but something went wrong with my pass, anyhow I expect to get another chance of  visiting the fine French town which is about 20 miles distance. Vi told me the experience you had at the circus, rather amusing. Wish I could have been with you and enjoyed ourselves like we did at the circus last year. Never mind will tell little Mac next year eh kiddie. That dream you had was very funny indeed, wish you were over here what sort of a good time we would have, what say you? Very pleased indeed to hear you are real well. I wonder how things are going with you at this present moment 3:40 PM. Suppose the great event is over or there is great excitement awaiting the event. Anxiously waiting for the cable now dearie. As you say the DAC is better than signaling but of course soldier has no say in the matter. I was in the DAC for about a fortnight before being transferred to the fifteenth battery. If you are in communication with aunty Fon tell her I will answer her long letter as soon as possible, have no idea when this will be because we are moving within a few hours. The weather of late has been extremely hot easily as hot as Australia, but we don't mind, it is better than the cold and we can keep cool by going for a swim. We have had to all three storms a day lately. The lightning and thunder is pretty severe. Most of the boys who I was with  at Lark Hill passed out of the school last month so I suppose they are on the way by this. Would be pleased to see Crowley and Hewitt again. The album of photos which I left in Blighty to be sent to you was delayed owing to some of the photos not coming to hand but it ought to be well on its way by this. We were going to hold sports tomorrow but they have been canceled indefinitely.</p>

<p>Well dearest I now say au revoir for the present tons and tons of kisses to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband.</p>
