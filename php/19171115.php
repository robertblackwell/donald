<h2>Sand Hill Camp</h2>

<p>Longbridge Deverill Warminster
15th November 1917</p>

<p>My own darling wife and bonny son</p>

<p>News is very scarce, kiddie, I'll try and write a few lines. This is a very poor camp, there's nothing right with it. Food is awful, have complained in other camps but this is absolutely the worst. If it does not improve there is sure to be serious trouble. The drill is severe and on an empty stomach the boys are beginning to kick up. Mailing arrangements are rotten, there are thousands of letters at the post office for the boys, but we can't get them. There is absolutely no system, just like all of our Australian organisations. </p>

<p>Today I received my watch from the jeweler, hope it is alright this time. Last night four of us went to the camp pictures, they were first rate, about the best program I’ve seen in England. Have seen a good deal of Eric Hewitt lately, but he is leaving tomorrow for Heytesbury Camp which is about 4 miles from here. There's another batch leaving here next Tuesday so no doubt I will be off with that lot. Will not be sorry either, anywhere would be better then here.</p>

<p>I see by the papers that there is going to be another attempt to pass conscription in Australia. Personally I don't give it a hope. As for the boys both here and in France 75% are positively against conscription. Billy Hughes and his followers can say what they like, the boys are fed up and will vote “No”. There is a great feeling of unrest right throughout the Australian army caused by the authorities themselves.</p>

<p>There has been a gang of men hanging round these camps and  Hurdcott sandbagging. A corporal, the night before going on leave to get married was knocked and relieved of £40, he died within half an hour. Another man was hit and  £14 taken, he recovered. A nurse was hit, not seriously and the paperboy poor kid about 12 was bagged  and relieved of his few coppers. He lingered for 5 days and passed away. It's not certain who is doing this work, but some of the Australian boys must be doing it. It's absolutely unsafe to go out on the roads at night by oneself. There's fully a dozen or more cases where our men and officers have been knocked lately. </p>

<p>Warminster, a fairly large town is about 4 miles from here, intend going In on Saturday all going well.</p>

<p>How is darling Neville getting on sweetheart. Wish I could get away from here over to my two darlings. What a good time we would have, eh sweetheart, never mind dear,  the time is surely coming when we three will be together having the time of our lives. Au revoir for the present Love and kisses to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever own and loving husband and father with kisses galore.</p>
