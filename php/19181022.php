<p>Dear Mrs MacDonald</p>

<p>Your husband was under my care for the very short time he was in hospital. He was admitted suffering from influenza followed by bronchial pneumonia. He was very ill, but I did hope he would pull through but he suddenly changed, and passed away quite quickly. I was with him at the time he died, I can only assure you he died peacefully and quietly. While conscious I told him I was going to write to you and asked him if he had any message, he said he sends his love and regretted he did not feel well enough to write. The short time he was with me he was an excellent patient and I am very sorry his life could not be spared. I have gathered his personal belongings together and you will be receiving them shortly. </p>

<p>Please accept my sincere sympathies.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours</p>
<p>H. Emmerson</p>
<p>Sister Hut 8</p>
