<h2>7th January 1917</h2>

<p>My dearest wife
This is Sunday afternoon and all going well tomorrow night will see us very close to the shores of the old dart and Tuesday morning will see us landed. Writing paper has run out so this letter which will be the last written on board will therefore have to be short. Since my last letter nothing of importance has happened. Last Tuesday a three masted sailing boat put in an appearance the “Kent” Immediately made off for her but everything was okay. Wednesday we had a full dress parade, marching orders including hammock and blankets, this was practically an inspection. The same day another boat was examined but everything okay. Thursday proved very exciting, a Dutch steamer refused to get off our back, two shells were fired, off she went. The same thing happened last night a steamer got too close for the Kent’s liking, off went two shots, so did the steamer.</p>

<p>The weather now is very cool or rather cold, lovely English weather. On Friday we had a very good look at the Pt Nicholson she came right along side of us that close that the boys from both boats were singing out to one another. The other day our mess orderlies got a trifle merry with the results we had to get out own meals, they were dead  funny. The boys are in great spirits especially after lights out when instead of being on a transport you would think you were in a farm yard at break of day. The YMCA has issued us with plans of London and particulars as to how and where to get to the huts. Since leaving Sydney the YMCA has issued to the men 20,000 printed letterheads, 10,000 plain 15,000 envelopes and 5000 postcards. They also issued 2000 books and papers (reading material). These books were recalled on Friday and the great number of three were returned. Where the 1997 got to we'll leave that to the boys. Went to church this morning at 10 o’clock. In my last letter I mentioned the City of Spasa  should be the City of Sparta please make the correction.</p>

<p>The weather today is very cold and the sea choppy. Received word a little while ago that we would be shortly running into heavy seas so all portholes have been closed. At 5 o'clock this afternoon we picked up the destroyers. Darling as soon as possible after we land I will write and more importantly send  you a cable, eh kiddie sweetheart.
I will enclose a photo, it is not too good but it is better than none at all, what say you my dear. I have the film so will send that also at a later date. We expect to get four days leave after we have been in camp a week or so. This is all the news. How are you getting on sweetheart? How is the young McDonald progressing? Dearest you are not out of my mind for one minute. A  number of us are  very hopeful regarding the peace talk, so that we will be able to get back to our loved ones.
Dear it seems a life time since we were together but I am in great hopes of an early return to you dear kiddie. Keep your pecker up love. I am in good health sincerely hope you are.</p>

<p>Remember me  to all. Love to mum and dad also all at Charles Street.</p>

<p>To my darling wife with ever true and sincere love, with tons of kisses and thousands of embraces.</p>
