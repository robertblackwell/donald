<h2>Hendcott Camp*, 29th of October 1917</h2>

<p>My own dear wife and darling son</p>

<p>On Friday I received another old mail, seven letters in all, two from you darling, Numbers 66 and 67, 2 from mum, 1 Charlie Edwards, 1 Elsie, and a booklet, ”Private Papers for those on Active Service’ from Arnold Connelly. Was very surprised to hear that Grace and Bert Walters are doing the deal .</p>

<p>Charlie Edwards  letter was full of news, he is the only member of the “Pie Club left, every one having enlisted. Mum’s second letter was written on June 24th the day after the arrival of our darling. There was no doubt about her being excited, her letter plainly showed that, why should she not to be excited, as from what I hear, Neville is absolutely the most wonderful baby born.</p>

<p>2 PM Saturday, three of us left camp and caught a motor for Salisbury arriving at about 2;30 o'clock. Had a lot of shopping to do for all the other boys in the hut, which took up all the afternoon. While in London my watch went wrong, cost me 8/6 to have it cleaned etc. Then after getting into camp it went wrong again, so I had to leave it at a jewelers on Saturday another 4/-. The watch is suffering from shell shock I think. Had afternoon tea at the Council Chambers. This place is used as a tea room and rest for soldiers. After tea we went to the theatre and witnessed a very good show. I had a weekend pass, the other two boys only a Saturday pass, so they returned to camp. I slept at the YMCA, a fine room and bonser bed for 1/6. Had a glorious nights sleep, simply beautiful to get between white sheets. Very late when I got up on Sunday morning and it was close on eleven o'clock before I finished breakfast. After having a good feed went for a walk round the river, read the Sunday papers and had a good smoke. After dinner started for a walk round, when I met one of the boys who came over from Australia at the same time as myself. Of course we had a good talk over old times. It was only five minutes after leaving him when I met another old pal, one of my best friends on the boat and while in camp. His name is Genett and he is on very friendly terms with Rita Pilgrim. When we met, talk about being excited, had we been girls, it's certain we would have embraced one another. Went for a walk, had afternoon tea at the council chambers. He has a staff job in Salisbury so boards with private people. He took me round to his ‘dugout’, met the people, tea together and afterwards a good old talk over the fire. These people want me to make their home, my home when in Salisbury, don't think I'll avail myself, for I expect to be leaving here this week. They are very nice people indeed. Of course it's very nice to have a private home to go to when you get tired of strolling around. Caught motor at 8:30 and turned into camp bed about 10 o'clock. While in Salisbury I bought a frame for my photo, but they have not yet arrived, have written giving them a hurry up. Also bought a number of Christmas cards which I sent along this morning.</p>

<p>Darling I willing enclose one of the cards, I think them capital. Soon as I returned last night a letter was handed to me, who do you think it was from, well Mrs Crowley. She is working in a Ladies Canteen at the Australian headquarters. Wants to know if she can be of any assistance to me regarding clothes money etc. Told me also that Eric Hewitt has just come out of hospital and going into camp again. Have no idea what's been wrong with him. Very good of her writing me. Wants me to call and see her if I'm in London.</p>

<p>I'm nearly frozen, can hardly write so please excuse, must finish so as to catch the mail. Received a letter from Don today. Will now close darling, I will write soon as I get warm again.
Love and kisses by the millions to my dear wife and darling son from your ever own loving husband and father with oceans and oceans of kisses and love.</p>

<p>Your loving husband and father</p>

<p>Ice everywhere today, for the first time. I'm just about frozen. Love Don</p>

<p>Do not take this Christmas card for my Christmas greetings to my two darlings. Sending something far better along. Daddy</p>
