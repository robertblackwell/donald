<p>My Darling Wife and Bonny Son</p>

<p>Now for a few lines, kiddie although there's very little to write about, but of course must not neglect my love once, eh dear. Still in my job it's not too bad, gets me free passes to the pictures. Sunday night having nothing to do went to the movies and thoroughly enjoyed them. Monday Tuesday and today have been bitterly cold, water frozen everywhere although it's beautiful in the sun. Yesterday I had a Christmas card from Miss Sutton in the office. Received £2 from Nellie today, the rate I'm going the tenner will soon be gone.” The Maitland Girls Patriotic Christmas” Parcel received this afternoon. Very nice indeed, can assure you, I greatly appreciated receiving same. Suppose you know what it contained, well in case you don’t, lollies, tobacco, sugar, chocolate and milk writing pad, handkerchieves, zig zag chewing gum. Will write to the league one day this week thanking them for it. Went up to see George tonight but he was out, going up again as soon as I finish this letter. </p>

<p>By the way darling what jokes are you putting Nellie up to. She wants to know the meaning of “Holy Moses”. I'll give it to her, also wants to know about the Patterson affair. In my next letter she will get all the Australian slang to satisfy her.</p>

<p>Kiddie, dear, how is ‘bubs’ getting on, always thinking of my two darlings. What a great time you must be having with him. You say he is wonderful, he must be more than wonderful the photos are simply lovely, kiddie I would give anything to be back and to have you on one knee and ’bubs’ on the other. When I do get home, what a time we will have, eh sweetheart.</p>

<p>The prospect of an early termination of the War are very remote, Russia*  has done it, gives one the hump to think about it. Heard yesterday that some German mines were found off Gab Island, where next will they be found, Farley Harbour no doubt. </p>

<p>Well sweetheart will now say au revoir, hope to have more news in next letter. Love kisses and embraces to my dear little wife and darling son, with heaps of love and oceans of kisses from your ever loving and sincere</p>

<p>Husband and daddy</p>

<p>*Russian Revolution
In the October Revolution (November in the Gregorian calendar), the Bolsheviks led an armed insurrection by workers and soldiers in Petrograd that successfully overthrew the Provisional Government, transferring all its authority to the soviets with the capital being relocated to Moscow shortly thereafter. The Bolsheviks had secured a strong base of support within the soviets and, as the now supreme governing party, established a federal government dedicated to reorganizing the former empire into the world's first socialist republic, practicing soviet democracy on a national and international scale.</p>

<p>Soon after, civil war erupted among the "Reds" (Bolsheviks), the "Whites" (counter-revolutionaries), the independence movements and the non-Bolshevik socialists. I</p>
