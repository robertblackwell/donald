My dearest wife

Here is a postcard which might interest you. Wet and cold today, ice an inch thick, had to be broken before having a wash. Snowing again yesterday. Mud right up to our knees. Went to the pictures last night, don't think I'll go again for a long time. Prices are 4p, 7and1/2p.

Have just written to Mr. Paton and Bearsoth.

No more letters to hand yet. Suppose Keith is over here by this, would like to know where he is, for his sake I hope he does not come to this camp, I don't think he will. Did a 9 mile march yesterday morning, very tired after it.
Crowley just came in and told me he just received a wire from his wife. She is safe and sound, arrived last night.Oh darling if only I could get a wire saying you were here. Suppose I will have to wait until I return. 

Love and kisses my darling wife from your loving husband.
