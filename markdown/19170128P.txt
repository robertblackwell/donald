Postcard “under the spreading chestnut tree” The Smithy at Figheldean, Salisbury Plain.

My dearest wife

This is where I went yesterday afternoon and had a very good time. Five of us had photos taken under the tree. Will send you one kiddie as soon as I get them. The tree at present is bare not a leaf on it.

Love Don
