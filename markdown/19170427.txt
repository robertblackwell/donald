## France, 27th April 1917

Dear Neita

Received your letter a few days ago. There is absolutely no news to tell you at present, it really gets monotonous writing the same old stuff every time. I suppose by this you will be receiving letters from Don the delay would probably be the long run from Cape Town to England no mile can leave. Received letters from uncle Frank, Vic and Vi, and a parcel from home. Thanks for parcel I have enough clothes now I think to last me forever. Things have been going rather brisky lately around this way. It is getting nice and warm here now, just about time. I want to see this sunny France. Fritz has taken it into his head to sink all hospital ships so they are establishing hospitals down in the south of France.(No more Blighty).

Well Neita no more news at present. I saw in yesterday's Daily Mail that  E Capper  R.F.6 was posted as missing, I wonder is that Teddy Capper. If it is him will send a London paper over. Well Neita can't hang out any longer. Love to all at home. Your affectionate brother.
