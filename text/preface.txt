As each of the Grandchildren have needed to downsize their homes the letters of our grandfather Donald Cameron McDonald have been moved several times. On the last move it was decided all three of us would examine all photos and document remaining from our grandparents and parents.

On close examination of Don's letters it was noted that these letters mostly written in ink but some in pencil would you not last much longer. Some letters are over 100 years old, others are nearly 100 years. So as the eldest granddaughter I took on the task of digitalising them,  before they were lost forever.

Don’s writing was very neat and legible, but age has made reading them difficult. I have done my best to record exactly what he wrote with the help of other eyes and magnifying glasses but sometimes the turn of phrase orl word has eluded me. Where places were mentioned but spelling difficult to decipher I have checked the validity where possible. Footnotes have been added to explain; expressions, word usage or places on occasion.

Many of the people mentioned were not known to me, however the following information maybe helpful:

Keith was Don's brother who served in WW1
Frank was Neita’s eldest brother who served in WW1
Vi was Franks fiancé who later married Lintott
George and Don were Neita’s brothers, the former served in WW1 the later was too young
Nelly Fry was Neita’s cousin living in England

The eldest grandson Michael McGrath perused these letters closely and wrote about them in a university assignment, his reflections are included here in the appendix.

What we three grandchildren have missed by not knowing our grandfather we will never know but by reading these letters and visiting his resting place in Rouen France we have come closer to knowing this wonderful man.
