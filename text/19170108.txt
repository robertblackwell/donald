Here are two excerpts found on postcards written about this time, neither are dated so I cannot be precise

January 1917

When we arrived on the parade ground we were supplied with rifles. Every available rifle in our own camp  and close camps were secured. Then our army of 400 started to march  off to _____   nobody knew. It was indeed a very anxious time, moving off and having absolutely no idea where we were going. And what a body, some with overcoats, some without, some leggings, some hats, some caps, some with leather boots, some with rubber boots, some short trousers, some long trousers, numbers without tunics, it was a mixed body. The reason for this was the urgency of our mission. Eventually we arrived in Amesbury, where a special train was waiting for us. Boarded the train.

January 1917

As soon as we arrived at the station Bournemouth we were supplied with bully beef and bread. Then we marched off from the station. Great excitement reigned arriving in a town like this, no doubt, kiddie you can understand my feelings. Eventually the soldiers Institute was reached where cocoa was provided. Then marched to the skating rink where we slept for the night. Talk about a rink simply beautiful. A gigantic building where amusement's of every description are held. Early next morning, tea was provided and again moved off through beautiful Bournemouth.
