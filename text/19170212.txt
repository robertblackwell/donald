Postcard  The Drawing Room, Strand Palace Hotel

My darling wife
Here are a few postcards of the hotel where I stayed while in London. A very fine place, no doubt you'll say the same, it “knocks the Australians into a cocked hat”.* The Tariff is very reasonable 6/6p bed and breakfast. Have not written a letter regarding the London trip yet, will do so tomorrow. Did not see much of this room, no use for it. Will explain everything in my letter. Would have given anything if you dear could have been with me. Never mind there is a good time coming, eh kiddie.
Love and kisses, tons of love
From your ever own loving husband

* Knock into a cocked hat’? means  to beat severly.
Of course, 'knocked into a cocked hat' only makes any sense if you know what cocked hats are. These were hats, popular at the end of the 18th century, that had turned up (that is, cocked) brims. They were usually tricorn (that is, three-cornered) hats and were often worn as part of some form of regalia.
