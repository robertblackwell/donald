9th September 1917

    Darling you will notice I left of writing and started again. It was this way, I was asked to take a  motor trip to a place called Barnet. Bet your life I accepted and broke regulations by clearing out of hospital, anyhow I never got caught so everything was okay. Had a great time will send some postcards of the place shortly. Yesterday 10:30 AM caught motors and arrive at our new home after a lovely trip. I am now at an Australian hospital at Harefield. Very very disappointed with the place, will only be here a day or two I think.
