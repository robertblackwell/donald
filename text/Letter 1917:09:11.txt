My darling wife and son
A few more postcards for the collection. This is the town I went to last Friday, after breaking out of hospital. Can assure you, thoroughly enjoyed the walk along this particular road, very pretty indeed. No news dearest this is a very dead and alive place. Yesterday went for walk around the village. Last night we had a picture show here, very good indeed, tonight there is to be a concert. Went under the x-ray for the wound in the back this morning, do not know the results yet, although the doctors said if there is any shell there it would be advisable to allow it to remain, will say later about that. I only heard a few moments ago that Lad was slightly wounded. Did the grand along the street eating chocolates. Wish you darling and our bonny son could have been with me, then everything would have just been okay. Never mind there is a day coming when we three will do, the la grand in fine style, eh sweetheart. Going on 14 days  furlough either Saturday or Monday. After that is finished I go into camp prior to going back to France.
