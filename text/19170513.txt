My dearest wife

I am one of the happiest men if not THE happiest man in camp today. 
Have just received the long looked for photos off your dear self. Cannot express in words how pleased I am, can assure you it is simply grand. The photos themselves are simply beautiful and how well you look. By jove dear you are looking well, and how pleased and jolly you look. If ever I feel a little out of sorts all I will have to do Will be to glance at the photos and then everything will be okay. You say you don't go much for one of them, that matters little, for I go a great lot on both, they are both simply great. It has taken some time for them to reach me. First they went to England then to France, back to Lark Hill, then to the signal school, back to headquarters and finally catching me up in our present camp. Being registered made all the difference, had the packet not been registered, more than likely it would have gone astray. But I have got them and hold them securely I certainly will. I'm enclosing some registered receipts which might be handy in  case some of the articles I have sent should go astray. Went to church this morning. On the flat near our camp I'll between 20 and 30 fruit, lolly, and postcard stalls conducted by half French and Flemish women. The articles are of a poor class, but needless to say very dear. Oranges the only fruit cost 2 and 3 p each. Prices all go up when Australians put in an appearance. Posted you a long later yesterday. Gave your photos each a good kiss that is as near as I can get to reality eh kiddie. 
Au revoir for the present. Kisses and embraces to my darling wife from your ever own and loving husband. Tons of love.
