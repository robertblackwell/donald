To my Darling Wife and Bonny Son

I’ve just finished one letter and posted it. So please kiddie don't be disappointed with a one pager. I’m broke, only good for 1/6p. I wrote to Nellie today, asking her to send me along 30 /-until the weather breaks. It's this way, I require several articles of winter clothing, gloves, socks etc. also at Christmas time I would like to give Nellie and Dorothy some small present. I have sent asking you to send along a tenner, kiddie it won't do any harm if you send along another fiver. Won’t go to waste. The money you will send along may not be here till after Christmas, but I sincerely hope and trust it comes long before then. I'll try my utmost to spend Christmas in England if successful, money, money, money will be needed. Will spend Christmas with Nellie if I'm in England. The chances are against my staying that long in Blighty.
Love kisses and embraces in galore to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever own and loving husband and father.
