My darling wife
Just heard that mail closes in 20 minutes for Australia so I thought I would drop you a few short lines. There is no news, cold still cold, today has been the coldest so far. We saw the sun today for about one hour it was simply great. This morning I was detailed to go into a school for signaling. Can get out of it. Do not really know what to do. Some say it is no good, others who have been to the front say it is the best job there. The school will last about three months maybe longer. Eric Hewitt and Crowley are in with me. After considering it from the several standpoints I think I'll go on with it. Do not think it's more dangerous work kiddie, everything in that line over at the front is now done undercover. Will make more inquiries later on and Iâ€™ll consider you too.

What I can personally see of it,  it's very good indeed. Anyhow can draw out of it at anytime. There's another mail ready for delivery tonight wonders if there is a letter from my dear wife sincerely hope so.
Saw by today's papers that the Pt Nicholson has been sunk. All the troops were off, so that is good. Food is getting very dear in England, and Germany from all accounts is in a very bad way. A man at the table told me that one English paper declares that the war will be over in six weeks time and if not, for every day over that time will give a certain sum to hospitals etc. I don't believe it.  But would it not be great back so soon with you darling. Anyhow time will come. Will now close for the mail.
Love and kisses to my dear wife from your loving husband

Have been thinking all day what joy it will be when we meet dearest, on the wharf on my return, the three of us. The sooner the better. Love kisses and embraces to my darling wife.
