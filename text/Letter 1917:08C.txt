Possibly August 1917

This is the hospital ship I came over from France on. She was painted iron grey and travelled as a transport, not as a hospital ship, for it is considered far safer for transports then hospital ships. Well darling I now say au revoir, will send some more postcards in a day or so. Suppose our dear boy is getting to be a fair scamp, look after him, kiddie till I get back, then I'll take a turn in looking after him and giving him a jolly good time. Love kisses and embraces to my darling wife and dear son from your ever loving husband with the millions and millions of kisses.
Your loving husband and father.        Don
