Dear Neita

Yours of July 19th duly to hand and of course I was pleased to hear from you once again. We are not exactly in France but in Belgium being just a few miles over the border working on the same front that Ted Roberts was winged, rather an unhealthy spot at present. Our last post was in the,  XXX* a fair size town and as I had a room in an estaminet** (hotel) it was like leaving home when we had to move. I was well and truly set. When in the above place I met many Maitland boys, including Jack Sawyer who was looking remarkably well and I had the opportunity of spending a few hours with him.

I had a letter from Don saying he had been on leave and also one from Dorothy Roberts to the effect that Don had paid them several visits, so I guess he got a fair dinkum Blighty. Now he wants to work the old nut.

Well Neita, it is now about 10 o'clock and the candle is just about no more so I must conclude these few lines in a hurry. There is one thing I must not forget to mention, that is to be sure and feed Neville Camesarete***   on bully beef and pork and beans for he is a moral (certainty) to be required as reinforcements before this business is over. He will therefore not find conditions quite so displeasing.

Yesterday afternoon I went up to the war (of course don't think that I had declared war) to rush the proceedings and also have a look at Ypres which has been completely knocked rotten. As missiles started to fly about rather too plentifully  we decided to quit, so took the first lorry back. Believe me some hero.
There are a few Aussie letters about here today, dated September 5th if my luck is in I might get one or two.

			Yours etc.
			   Keith

**estaminet means tavern
*** The word could be bumosoreto or Camesarete but possibly a turnip based biscuit or bread
