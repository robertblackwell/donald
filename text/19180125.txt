Sandhill Camp
25th January 1918

Dear father

Received your very welcomed letter dated November 11th  about a fortnight ago. I'm still going strong in this camp although things are very unsettled this week.. Hundreds have been warned for draft. We are only suppose to remain here three weeks, then overseas but of course these orders can be twisted  when ones in the know. Anyhow my time for leaving might come any day now. Keith is in England at present on 14 days leave. We have been together for a few hours.

I just returned from a weeks trip to Edinburgh. Keith was to have come with me but somehow he was nowhere to be seen when the train was due to leave. Scotland is a great place and needless to say  I had the time of my life. Visited all places of interest including Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, St Giles Cathedral, Firth Bridge etc. Went to Keith and saw a naval ship building yard. The trip up the Firth of Forth was very fine. Also had a day and night in London.

Looking forward to my next leave, Scotland will do me.

Love to all. Hope all are okay.

Love to Neita and Babs.

Your sincere son-in-law.
