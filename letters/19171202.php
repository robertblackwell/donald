<h2>Sand Hill Camp, Warminster, 2nd December 1917</h2>

<p>My Darling Wife and Bonny Son</p>

<p>While I think of it kiddie, will you let Vi, Paterson folk, Don and Auntie Jane know that I have received their Christmas cards, for which I am very pleased and  thankful. Over a month ago I sent them all cards which I sincerely hope they will receive. The reason why I'm asking you to let them know I received their mail is that when I'm writing later on, it's a cert I will forget all about them. Have very little to write about.  Just written short letters to Phyll, Flo and your mother. On Friday received a birthday parcel from the Greens bonsa. </p>

<p>Phyll must of course do something, she  included some salts, would like to give her a  …. to take at once, something doing then.*</p>

<p>Yesterday did not go anywhere, works for a few hours in the Q M stores and at night took a walk down the village with a few of the boys. Still going strong in my job and sincerely hope to do so for a long time. There's a chance of my spending Christmas in England. That will be grand, what say you sweetheart. The card from our darling boy Is lovely so also is the card from you sweetheart. Those words which express your thoughts darling also express mine. Wish to heaven we three were spending Christmas together, when we do get together what a time we will have eh sweetheart. Was talking to George yesterday, he is well, could not be better. He is well dug in for the winter. Bernie I understand  Is likely to go under another operation. This will be the last and then he will be able to get his leg. Have not heard anything of Sid or the £2 which you say he has for me. Two day is very cold, cannot grumble, taking everything into consideration the weather has been beautiful. I wrote to Nellie on Friday for some more money, suppose you will say dearest, am leading a gay life. Not me, spending a fortune in buying foodstuffs. This camp is the limit, starvation camp. Have no more news please excuse the short letter dear. Au revoir to my two darlings with tons and tons of kisses and oceans of love from your ever loving and sincere husband and father.  </p>
