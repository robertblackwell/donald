<h2>Sand Hill Camp, 
Christmas Day 1917</h2>

<p>My darling wife Neita and Bonnie son Neville</p>

<p>It is Christmas day sweetheart, and have had a fairly good day. Could not let the day pass without writing to my dear ones. Majority of the boys spent Christmas Eve drinking. They came home in a very happy mood. The jokes they got up to, laugh never laughed more in my life. My body is sore from laughing. Myself and another chap remained at home I wrote to mum and Phyll. The weather today was beautiful, not a cloud in the sky. </p>

<p>The chief item of the day, as always is meals. 
Well breakfast; ham, savaloys, bread butter jam and tea.
Dinner; Turkey, ham, potatoes, peas, cabbage, parsnips, (sauce salt pepper mustard) plum pudding with brandy sauce, finished up with beer for the drinks and ginger ale for the “woses’.
Tea; bread butter, jam, pineapple and custard, pastry.
The meals could not have been much better, what say you darling, everything went off okay. This afternoon four of us went for a walk to Kingston Deverill about 4 miles away had a good afternoon tea and returned to camp about 7 PM. It's 9:30 now so feeling fit for supper. Supper tonight consists of ham cheese and toast and cake. </p>

<p>Will be working for a few hours in the morning and then off for the day. Have no idea at present where I'm going. Saving my money until Keith comes over when I hope to be able to spend a few days with him, Scotland most likely. Tomorrow there's a large sports programme for the troops here, afraid there will be very few men present. Sweetheart this time last year never thought I'd spend this Christmas in camp thought it would have been spent in Australia with you dear heart and our darling baby. Sincerely hope and pray that we three will be spending next Christmas together. What a time we'll have eh sweetheart. Wrote you on Sunday kiddie so therefore I have little news to write about. Today I received the card from Mrs Crowley. I sent her one during the week. What sort of a Christmas did you give darling bubs, wish I could have shared it with you dear, giving him as good  a time as possible for the dear kid. Next Christmas I'll make a good Father Christmas. The issue of beer today was very liberal, too much so at present I can hear a terrible row outside, too much beer.</p>

<p>Au revoir for the present darling surely I'll be back this time next year with you two dear ones. Sincerely hope and trust you all spent a jolly merry time, also that my cable reached you today. Love kisses and embraces to my dear wife and darling son from your ever own and loving husband and father.</p>

<p>Don</p>

<p>Love to all at Regent and Charles Streets</p>
