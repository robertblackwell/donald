<h2>Lark Hill, 24th January 1917</h2>

<p>My own dear wife</p>

<p>Last night while over at the YMCA I heard that a mail closed the same night therefore I sat down and wrote a few lines to my dear. On returning to the hut I got a great reception what do you think it was, why three letters from my dear wife also the lettergram you sent to Freemantle. It was simply great to receive them.  First before tea tonight I received another of your loving letters. The letters received so far are numbers 1,3,5,6, and 7 therefore two and four are still missing. 7 came along today. There is no news to tell. I am still in the signal school and from numerous inquiries made it's a very good branch for the time being at any rate. Have to go through a riding school in connection with it, started this afternoon. This has been a heavy day, going strong the whole day from 6:30 AM to 7:15 PM. It's been a bitterly cold day. Some of the boys went skating on the waterhole. I did not take it on, no good to yours truly, have seen too much ice. Was very pleased when number one letter came along thought it had gone astray. </p>

<p>Keep up your writing dear, it is the only thing I look for on this side. Your letters dearest make a great difference in yours truly. Your photos were very welcomed. Will place them with the others. Of course only one will accompany me to bed that's the one of your self only. That's three I take to bed with me. Very surprised to hear that you saw me on the tram the morning of embarkation. Never mind dearest as you say we will make up for it on my return,  especially as there will be another “Mac” to welcome me. </p>

<p>So you won a cake, well done my little wife. You mentioned about me wanting money, don't think I'll require any for some time, have plenty at present. You say that the military money and office money is coming along okay. I am very pleased indeed. Be sure to let me know from time to time how they are treating you. One of the hut boys just received his Christmas parcel, needless to say there is great joy, everybody is eating lollies. Very sorry indeed that the photo from the camp is no good, send it back kiddie, although I suppose it is too late now.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Don McDonald is “some class” that's right, she always was, keep it up, darling. Little Mac will be “some class” too, eh sweetheart. What would I give to be home somewhere about June, what say you dearest. So the photos from the Swiss were okay, that is good. Buy fancy saying that in one of my photos I had a cantankerous look. Not me kiddie. If I could get hold of you I’d give you a big smack on the lips, here have it X. Very sorry to hear you had trouble with your teeth, but get them stopped, false teeth are no good darling. I suppose you wrote Mrs. Asser thanking her for the scarf. I prefer the main one of the two every time. The parcel has not arrived yet, does not matter how bad the cigars are they will be very welcomed, anything from home and especially from my darling wife is welcomed in this hole. Will keep a sharp look out every day for my darling's parcel. Write just as you like dear, your letters are not censored at all so be sure and give me all the news about yourself. I'm always thinking of you and Little Mac. Same as you I was thinking how great it will be to hear the young scamp (sure to be) calling mum or dad. Of course I can guess what your dream was about wait till I come back then……</p>

<p>You used the word d…. could not write it, very surprised but you are right it is worse than a d…war. The mail does not close for a couple of days so will continue this later tomorrow, going to bed now. Have not got you love to sleep with, so I do the same as you, take your photos with me. Good night darling love and kisses to my dear wife with a strong embrace. XXXXXXXX</p>

<p>Well dear another day over and nothing very startling.</p>

<p>Out riding this afternoon also received another pay of 1/-/-. Plenty of money for the present time. Saw the new Moon just a little while ago, of course had a wish. You can bet you're sweet life what it was. Have wrapped up a paper to send to dad and the soon as I finish this letter will drop a line to mum. I'm writing this in the YMCA ,“Y Emma” as it is known by the boys. Have not heard anything of Keith yet, I suppose he will soon reach this side.</p>

<p>Wrote a letter to Nelly Fry the other day.</p>

<p>Well dear wife I will now say au revoir. The next mail closes on 29 January so will write again before that. Love and kisses to my dear little wifey.</p>

<p>Your ever own and loving husband</p>

<p>Don
</p>

<p>PS I started numbering my letters but forgot a number so left it off. Don't think it is necessary for me to number the letters as they are sure to arrive at there destination.</p>

<p>Love and kisses</p>
