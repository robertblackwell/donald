<h2>Rev HW MacKay CE,
3rd Stationery Hospital Rouen,
November 16th 1918</h2>

<p>Miss Nellie Fry<br />
Dear Madam</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that I cannot give you any particulars as to the death of Donald McDonald. While he was in the hospital, I had gone into hospital myself with influenza and was therefore unable to see him, but my work was taken by another Chaplain.</p>

<p>I find in our records that 30280 Gunner DC McDonald was admitted he is suffering, I should presume from the prevailing epidemic of influenza, and pneumonia following. He died at 9:10 on the morning of October 22nd. The epidemic was at its worst just at that time, and in a severe case there is really very little to be done. I need not assure you that everything that could be done was done by doctors and nurses. But the worst cases baffled all treatment.
I should assume that if he was able to write to you on the 20th his case took a sudden turn for the worse.</p>

<p>He was buried on October 24th with  military honours in S Sever Cemetery, Rouen. The number of his grave is 7914.</p>
<p>If you apply to the </p>

<pre>Director of Graves Registration
Winchester House
St James Square
London SW</pre>

<p>giving date of death, number of grave, a photograph will be taken and sent to you or to his next of kin, if you give their address.</p>

<p>I am very sorry this is so unsatisfactory, but you will understand why. 
With much sympathy in the case of your cousin.</p>

<p>Yours very faithfully</p>
<p>H.W. MacKay</p>
