<h2>Heytesbury Camp,
New Warminster,
6th March 1918</h2>

<p>My Darling Wife and Bonny Son</p>

<p>Note the new address. Had a terrible slip, my good time has come to an end very sorry to say. On Monday word came to Sand Hill Camp that any artillery men had to go in the draft immediately. </p>

<p>How the trouble arose was an artillery chap was put on guard against his wishes, he the fool wrote to Birdwood and complained  with the result word came through that we all had to leave.
Talk about a stir there is no name for it. Not one me man was was left in his job. I try my hardest to miss the draft but no luck. Two officers tried their hardest for me but the Brigadier said it was a definite order from the General so that was the end of it.</p>

<p>Well kiddie you can well imagine my disappointment, but had to make the most of it. It took them a whole day to find me but when they did no mistake was made.</p>

<p>Saturday, 9 March
Darling you see I’ve knocked off and started this letter again. This is a rotten camp, food  very poor indeed. What sooner be in France than remaining in this present camp. Had a go to get into the signal school, no luck the OC of our battery what not grant a transfer because being to France once I’ve got to get back again as soon as possible. No rest for men who have been over there. Friday morning I was warned to proceeds overseas next Tuesday but the dentist pulled  me off, have to get a few teeth stopped. That means a delay of about a week. No doubt now that with the changed camp my mail will be hung up. Two day I received a parcel from Nellie I does and fresh eggs have a feed tonight to be sure. Also got a letter from her mentioned having received a letter from George written at Southhampton. Charlie Tailer has spent a couple of days at Fairmead. Bernie has to undergo another operation his  leg is much swollen, a piece of dead bone has to be removed. Poor Bernie he is having a very tough time. On my way through Harve to the line I'll try and see Harry Beardson do not think there's much chance for our stay at Harve is for only about 24 hours. I’ve sent all my private belongings to Nellie. Intentionally sending my watch to her. Something has gone wrong with it still keeps good time but the parts which turns the hands round won't work. It's no use taking you to France in that condition have not got enough time before leaving to get it repaired. </p>

<p>How are you sweetheart and darling Bubs getting on. Had a real dream about Bubs the other night. I was home among you all and Bubs was running about large as life. But the  troubling part of it was, he was running after your father saying dad dad. This is your dad pointing to me but the poor kid  could not make head or tail out of it. Tell you, I was very annoyed. 
By jove sweetheart. Life in this camp is quite different to Sand Hill, it was home, without a doubt. This place is enough to break any man's heart.</p>

<p>Darling another parcel of yours came to hand at Sandhill. I left the day after it arrived, no doubt it will catch me up in a few days time. Feel very unsettled so sweetheart please excuse if this letter is not up to the mark. How do you like the state of things over this way. Things don't look very bright I can assure you. Fritz seems to be getting stronger every day, instead of getting back to France would be better if we were returning to my two darlings but never mind dearest there'll come a time some day when I'll be making my way through Sydney heads and what you today that will be. Don't mention it eh darling. All our batteries in France are 25% over strength and at the present rate of things they will soon be 50% okay. The draft to leave here Friday is about 750 strong. Reinforcements are not coming from Australia so it won't be long ere our camps are empty. Fully expected to have had another few days leave . No hope now will have to try Paris for my next stunt.</p>

<p>Will now ring off sweetheart tons and tons of love and kisses galore to my darling wife and bonny son your own loving hubby and daddy with the oceans of love and kisses XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX </p>
<p>Your loving husband and father</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>X X to darling Neville</p>

<p>Kisses and embraces.</p>
