<h2>11th of January 1917, On land</h2>

<p>My darling wife</p>

<p>On Sunday 7th January we picked up nine destroyers one for each transport. It was a great sight, a sight never to be forgotten. Then there was a race for port the Marathon came first Benalla second. The last two days were very rough and bitterly cold but we thoroughly enjoy it. We arrived in Devenport Tuesday (9th January 1917) morning at 1 o'clock, up  out of bed at 4 o’clock, breakfast at 5 o'clock and then got ready for going off. After a terrible lot of bother we got off the boat that afternoon at 2 o'clock and caught the train at 3 o'clock for Ainsbury arriving at 10:30 that night. Then we had to march 4 miles to our camp, turning into bed at 1 o'clock in the morning. My first impressions of old England are very good, what we saw of the country and towns was very fine indeed. We stopped at Exeter for about 15 minutes where refreshments were provided in bags by the towns people. In the bag was a  card which I am enclosing.Tea was also provided. It was simply lovely to be treated so cordially, we had not had anything to eat since five in the morning. All the boys greatly appreciated the good things. We are at present camped at Lark Hill, Ainsbury, (Amesbury) it is simply hell but we may only stay here I a few days. Yesterday we had snow and today rain. It is that cold at present I can hardly write.</p>

<p>Just had a great disappointment, the mail has just been brought and none for me, feel just anyhow but I suppose I will get them in a few days.  This is Friday, I left off this letter very abruptly last night. Joe Cook and a friend of his came in to see me. I also saw Joe the night before. We had a great talk over things, he is off to France tomorrow. George left about a fortnight ago, Stan Coldrake also left last week. Joe received a letter from Sid yesterday.</p>

<p>After they left last night, what do you think I got, well the  letter gram you sent kiddie to the address in Melbourne. It was simply lovely darling, put me in good spirits, waiting very anxiously for your letters sweetheart. </p>

<p>Met young McKay of West Maitland a couple of times. It is very funny indeed how all the boys show one another photos and letters etc. that they have received from Australian girls. I have read a great number written by Maitland girls also several photos. This is a very large camp but men from Maitland, New South Wales are continually stopping one and asking all sorts of questions most particularly about girls. You have to come away from home to hear news. Last night I met a young chap by the name of Mallett. He asked me  of Maitland and if I knew the Price girls. Well to make a long story short. We have met before, introduced by Jessie Price out side the church. He shared letters written by them also photos and one letter had the full description of our wedding. He said from the account it must have been the greatest wedding seen in Maitland. So it was, eh kiddie. It is wonderful how we all come together. He is a great friend of Joe Cook but as Joe is  leaving on Saturday Mallett being rather lonely is going to call on yours truly fairly often.</p>

<p>At the present moment it is raining. Darling my letters I am afraid in the future will not be long as we have very little time to ourselves and it's that cold at night we all turn in. Anyhow my darling I will write every opportunity I get. Tell mum and dad that I will not be able to write like I did while on the boat but I'll do my best. There are about 90,000 Australians in camp in England. The camp Salisbury is absolutely the worst camp in England. No training to speak of, all fatigues. It is purely a depot camp. We did more drill in the “Warren”. The trouble is it is under Australian management that in itself speaks “rotten”. The Salvation huts here are absolutely great. They heat one, first rate and food etc. very reasonable. The Salvation certainly comes first as far as this camp is concerned. Eggs here are 6p each.
I will now close for the present darling will write again before the next mail closes. Love kisses and embraces to my darling wife from your loving husband. Hope you are well. I am feeling okay but bitterly cold.

I am enclosing film and card. Our officers on the trip over were absolutely rotters. It would be practically impossible to get worse  officers. For the present we have lost them except Lak. All the officers onboard were rotters, rotters. Going up to see Lak tonight. Had nine deaths coming over, four men were put off, two in Durban and two in Cape Town. We understand that three off those passed away. We were all praying to get the trip over. Everybody had their lives frightened out of them. The doctors were only doctors in name. They had no idea what was wrong with the men. In one case they operated for meningitis and it was sunstroke, another man had the “DTs” and he was operated on for meningitis. Everybody got “wet” nurses, officers and men. Anyhow I did not have one day of sickness for which I am very thankful. </p>

<p>Flying machines are here in scores they are a very fine sight. It has stopped snowing. There are a number of picture shows close and handy  but I am afraid I will not have much time to go and see them. Have no idea when we go on leave. Wish this blooming war was over kiddie. Anyhow darling from the look of things here, it may not be very long.</p>

<p>Au revoir my dear wife.
Love and kisses from your loving husband.</p>

<p>Don</p>

<p>We are at camp 21 Lark Hill but my address will be as of old, until we go to France. </p>

<p>Give mum and dad all the news.</p>

<p>Sent you a cable two days ago, money scare. You should receive it on Monday. It is snowing very heavily at present and we have to parade in it. Rain etc. makes no difference. We are all in huts 30 to each. Large fire in centre of hut. 
Love to my darling. How are you progressing love?
Your loving husband.</p>

<p>Don</p>
