<h2>2017 January 1st</h2>

<p>My Darling Wife</p>

<p>This is Monday January 1, 1917 so will wish you a bright and prosperous new year to the fullest extent to my darling wife. Owing to our being in the danger zone no New Year's Eve disturbance took place, everybody getting off to bed very early. Early this morning compliments were flying around but it was only half hearted as our thoughts were all back at home with our loved ones. I was wondering what you would be doing dear. Today the weather is great but the sea is a little choppy. In a day or so we should strike rough weather that is if we are going to get any, just received more wireless news the most interesting being Englandâ€™s answer to Germany's peace proposals. We all received 10 shillings pay today. The boys were all broke so it came just when needed. But the trouble is that the best part of it goes on drink.</p>
<p>Of the nine transports we are  the only one to have a wet canteen.</p>
<p>This is only going to be a one page letter my dear, there is absolutely no news but I thought my dear little wife would like a few lines written on the first day of the new year.</p>
<p>The food has been very much off of late, no porridge, potatoes or tea, all are craving to get to the old dart to get a good meal and a fresh water bath. </p>

<p>Again I wish my wife an exceptionally bright year, 1917. Love and kisses to my darling wife from your ever true and loving husband. Tons of kisses and embraces.</p>
<p>Don</p>
