<p>My Darling Wife and Bonny son</p>

<p>I wrote you Sunday also yesterday so kiddie please excuse this short note. In one of my letters I mentioned having asked the agent general to cable to you for money, well today I received word from them stating that they had ceased cabling to Australia for money for soldiers so kiddie please send me along some money, which ever way you think best, so that it will be in the bank when ever I require it. Have about 2 pounds in my pocket at present, but if good luck should come my way and I get more leave, well until that arrives I will have to borrow off some of my rich relations. </p>

<p>Should I be here for the weekend intend spending from noon Saturday until Sunday midnight at Salisbury. That takes money. But of course one must have a good time when possible, now that I am in dear old Blighty. </p>

<p>Today received two letters one from Dorothy and one from Annie Roberts. Dot’s letter was very nice indeed, said they were sorry I could not have spent more time with them, she said I had made quite a hit with the family, what do you think of that sport, some class your hubby, darling. She also sent me at tin of tobacco. Owing to the numerous air raids they left Herre Hill today for a more quiet shop. Working 30 miles from London. All London people if possible are leaving for districts not in the raid area. Bournemouth is simply crowded with such folk, impossible to get houses or even apartments there. Dot could not give me their new address but intends sending it as soon as they get settled.</p>

<p>Annie wrote in reply to my letter. Asked me to come again as soon as possible also wants one of my photos. She wished to be remembered to all you people. Kiddie I am always looking at those photos of you and our little darling. They are ‘bosca’. Neville is in three studies, laughing. asleep and wide awake with a stern look. Could not have had them taken better, simply lovely, wish I could take him in my arms and give him a good squeeze and kiss. The day is coming when I will be able to do it, eh dearest. Sooner the better.</p>

<p>Going to a concert tonight with a few of the boys, at the YMCA expect it to be good. Last night went to a lecture on the greatest of the British Empire. Please excuse short note, you understand don’t you darling.</p>

<p>Love kisses and embraces to my two darlings from your most loving husband and father with thousands of kisses and oceans of love.</p>

<p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hubby and Daddy</p>
