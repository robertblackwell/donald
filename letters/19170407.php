<p>My darling wife</p>

<p>This is Easter Saturday but as far as camp life is concerned the day is no different from any other. Sun has been shining all day, absolutely the best we have had since arriving in “Blighty”*</p>

<p>The Australian mail has been delayed it appears as only a dozen or so  letters have reached the whole camp for about a month.
Yesterday Good Friday was a day of hard work. Sweetheart receive your weekly Mercury today, have read every part of it. Simply grand to read about dear old Maitland. Also received a note dated 15th of January from Vic Moree. Mrs. Smith sent me another small parcel today. Have written you several letters this week darling, mentioning that I received the draft okay, soon that I am financial will try my hardest to get into civilization for a few days. Keith is wondering how he will get on  for some money from home, would have been  a good plan had dad done the same is you, we'll see Keith next weekend so will tell him all about my wife's thoughtfulness in looking after  hubby. He may like them to do the same. Today we were inspected by Brigadere General Moore at Bulford. This was a ‘get ready’ for the ‘Kings review’ which is supposed to take place next week. There were about 5000 men, engineers, light horse, cyclists, artillery, infantry motor transport, and army services.</p>

<p>Keith’s unit was there of course I did not see him. Flying machines were very numerous and caused a good deal of excitement in doing fancy dives. Brig. Gen. Patton was also there. We made a start at 5 o'clock o'clock this morning and returned about 2 PM took lunch with us. The new summertime starts from tomorrow that means placing the clock on one hour. No good for getting up but it will be just the thing after parade hours having a more light. A number of our men passed out as first call signalers this week and are now on draft, expect that they will leave for France  about Monday or Tuesday. I expect to be going for a test in a week or fortnight’s time. Number 2 class is my class at present, I suppose I’ll have a course in number one. Darling the news today will please you, I’m sure. American seized 91 Hun boats and at the same time declared war. It seems the general opinion that although America has declared war it will be months and months before her entry will be felt to any degree. Anyhow it's good news eh dearest and I am sure it will have some effect on the German people. It will certainly shorten the war.</p>

<p>That's everything kiddie, means that I'll get back to”my all” much sooner. Sooner the better, what say you sweetheart.</p>

<p>How are you getting on. By the time you receive this letter, the time for the great event will be very close. The sooner it is over the better, no doubt you say. Keep your pecker up I'm sure everything will be okay. When you are writing tell me all dearest and let me know by cable the news of the great event, absolutely as soon as possible. Fancy being called mum and dad. That's what we used to say but it's getting very close to reality now. You'll make a good mother too for certain, they is a chance of you spoiling Little Mac but who would not, what it will be the greatest child in the world eh dearest. Anxiously waiting for your letters dear I suppose  they will come in due course. Well darling I'll now ring off going to drop a line home. Love and oceans of kisses to my darling wife from your loving husband with oceans and oceans of kisses. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx </p>

<p>Don</p>

<p>It's jolly cold tonight have no fire. A cuddle would be just grand but what a cuddle we will have darling whether hot or cold for my return, that will be the time kiddie. Au revoir for tonight. </p>

<p>Love and kisses.                     Don</p>
