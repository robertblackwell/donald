<h2>Hendcott Camp, 4th November 1917</h2>

<p>My darling wife and bonny son</p>

<p>This is Sunday afternoon, wonder what my two darlings are doing, wish I were back in dear old Maitland with you all, will be some day, the sooner the better eh sweetheart. On Friday I received a registered packet from Nellie containing my photos and 2 pounds, also a letter from Nellie and one from Aunt Rosa. </p>

<p>Well the photos, they are not too bad, Nellie says they are good, but not nearly good enough. Kiddie today I posted one to our darling son, one to your dear self and one to mum and Phyllis. There are two positions, cap on and cap off. Everybody says the one with  the cap on is the better of the two, of course it's a matter of opinion. Yours is the one with the cap on, and Neville’s which is in a frame, without, so darling you have both positions. You may think I'm thin by the photos but it's only in the face. To satisfy my darling will give you a little flap about myself. When I met some of the November quota boys last week, they all passed the remark, how well I looked, slightly thinner in the face, but the body the same, an ideal soldier. Was told by the jerk instructor the other day (been doing jacks and football for five weeks now) that I'm a perfectly built man, liar I said. He said being 5 foot 10, and weight 12.3 stone, solid, no surplus flesh, hard as nails, square shoulders makes a well built man. Anyhow kiddie there's no doubt about it, the jerks and good food have made a wonderful difference in me. The boys who came into camp with me often remark of my great improvement. The reason why I tell you this darling is to let you know exactly how I am, never felt better in my life. You use to rouse about my round shoulders, well kiddie, they are a thing of the past, if when I return, I am as I am now, you'll say come down a little you look too tall. </p>

<p>I suppose you would like to know who is  Aunt Rosa, well my adopted aunt, Mrs Morris. She was down at Nellie’s when my photos arrived so of course helped herself. She was of the same opinion as Elsie, her daughter, they preferred the one with the cap, as Elsie says “There is more devil in that one”. </p>

<p>Of course I told you that I had written to Nellie for some cash, well she sent along £2, I’m right again for a few days. She said it was from “The Bank of Love Ltd.” Finishes her letter such, your Guarding Angel, in England, Nellie. By jove she is a character kiddie, I sincerely hope you all meet her in the near future. Do not mention this to anybody.</p>

<p>She told me Bernie had been under another operation, a frightful operation, and not successful by any means, but he is getting better slowly. Yesterday I received a letter from mum, card from Jeanne Gordon and four papers from Phyll. Fully intended going to Salisbury yesterday, just about to leave camp when an order came through cancelling all leave, on account of a general mobilisation of the British and Australian armies. Needless to say I was wild, have nothing to do but sit about camp. Was very anxious to go into the city as I wanted to buy some Christmas cards, also get my watch, which I left at LJ Shy jewelers for repairs. When I am to get it now, goodness only knows, for it is not safe for it to be posted and I am sure to be leaving here during the week. Friday most probably. Just as well I got some money from Nellie for on Thursday all I had was I halfpenny, broke, it's terrible to be broke in the army, you cannot borrow for all the boys are more or less in the same position. </p>

<p>This morning I went to church, good, what say you darling, going to be good again tonight, off to the pictures. Last night went to a concert given by the “Dinkhums” three ladies and two gents very good show. </p>

<p>Hope you are taking good care of our dear Neville, I hope to be home before this time next year, then I'll take a hand, bet you like eh sweetheart. Would give anything to be nursing him now, don't think I’d get tired, do you think so kiddie. Well must ring off with love, kisses and embraces to my darling wife and bonny son from your ever own and loving husband and father with oceans and oceans of love and millions of kisses.
